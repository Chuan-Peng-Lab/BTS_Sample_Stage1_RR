Results suggest a two-sided benefit of resorting to verbal abuse.

Indeed, there are many potential explanations for such commonalities—accidents of history, common processes of language change, memory limitations, constraints on linguistic representations, and so on. Recent research has used psycholinguistic experiments to provide empirical evidence linking common linguistic patterns to specific features of human cognition, but these experiments tend to use English speakers, who in many cases have direct experience with the common patterns of interest.

From the perspective of evolutionary biology, abortion at a young age can represent prioritization of long-term development over immediate reproduction, a pattern established in other animal species as resulting from stable ecologies with low mortality risk. We examine whether laws and moral beliefs about abortions are linked to local mortality rates. Data from 50 U.S. states, 202 world societies, 2,596 adult individuals in 363 U.S. counties, and 147,260 respondents across the globe suggest that lower levels of mortality risk are associated with more permissive laws and attitudes toward abortion.

Here, we show that a self-report measure of impulsivity is highly correlated with performance in the highway task but not with traditional behavioral task measures of impulsivity (47 adults aged 18–33 years). By integrating deep neural networks with an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm, we inferred dynamic changes of subjective rewards during the highway task.

Investigating an important aspect for the ORE—that is, emotional expression—the seminal study by Ackerman and colleagues (2006) found that White participants remembered neutral White faces better than neutral Black faces, but crucially, Black angry faces were better remembered than White angry faces (i.e., a reversed ORE). In the current study, we sought to replicate this study and directly tackle the potential causes for different results with later work. Three hundred ninety-six adult White U.S. citizens completed our study in which we manipulated the kind of employed stimuli (as in the original study vs. more standardized ones) whether participants knew of the recognition task already at the encoding phase. Additionally, participants were asked about the unusualness of the presented faces. We were able to replicate results from the Ackerman et al.

We develop a new method for quantifying illusion strength (Experiments 1a and 1b), and we demonstrate a privileged role for rotational motion on illusion strength compared with highly controlled stimuli that lack rotation (Experiments 2a to 3b). These contrasts make it difficult to explain the illusion in terms of lower-level detection limits. Instead, we explain the illusion as a failure to attribute changes to locations. Rotation exacerbates the illusion because its perception relies upon structured object representations. This aggravates the difficulty of attributing changes by demanding that locations are referenced relative to both an object-internal frame and an external frame. Two final experiments (4a and 4b) add support to this account by employing a synchronously rotating external frame of reference that diminishes otherwise strong motion silencing.

Mather and Thayer proposed coupling between high-frequency HRV (HF-HRV) and neural oscillations as a mechanism that partially accounts for such relationships. We tested this hypothesis by measuring phase-amplitude coupling between HF-HRV and neural oscillations in 37 healthy adults at rest. Robust coupling was detected in all frequency bands.

Here we addressed this issue in a natural conversation involving 21 triadic adult groups. Results showed that when the listener’s attention dynamically switched between speakers, neural synchronization with the to-be-attended speaker was significantly enhanced, whereas that with the to-be-ignored speaker was significantly suppressed. Along with attention switching, semantic distances between sentences significantly increased in the to-be-ignored speech. Moreover, neural synchronization negatively correlated with the increase in semantic distance but not with acoustic change of the to-be-ignored speech.

We propose that people may fail to fully distinguish between merely observing behavior again (through replay) from that behavior being performed again in the exact same way. Using an assortment of stimuli that included auditions, commercials, and potential trial evidence, we demonstrated through nine experiments (N = 10,412 adults in the United States) that rewatching makes a recorded behavior appear more rehearsed and less spontaneous, as if the actors were simply precisely repeating their actions. These findings contribute to an emerging literature showing that incidental video features, like perspective or slow motion, can meaningfully change evaluations. Replay may inadvertently shape judgments in both mundane and consequential contexts.

We proposed that this inconsistency could be resolved by considering the source of violence: Is violence perpetrated by outsiders or intimate partners? Results of a multigroup structural equation model showed that endorsement of hostile sexism was related to greater tolerance of violence regardless of the source. In contrast, endorsement of benevolent sexism was associated with lower tolerance of violence from outsiders but was simultaneously associated with higher tolerance of spousal violence.

Participants saw a novel shape and then immediately adjusted a copy of that shape to match what they had seen. Surprisingly, participants reconstructed shapes in exaggerated form, amplifying curvature, enlarging salient parts, and so on.

U.S. American adults completed two tasks designed to measure creativity. Before each creativity trial, participants completed an unrelated search of a city map. Between subjects, we manipulated the search pattern, with some participants seeking multiple, dispersed spatial locations and others repeatedly converging on the same location. Participants who searched divergently in space were better at divergent thinking but worse at convergent thinking; this pattern reversed for participants who had converged repeatedly on a single location.

Using motion stimuli, a central-parietal positive-going electroencephalogram component (CPP) behaves as an accumulating decision variable that predicts evidence quality, RT, accuracy, and confidence (Experiment 1, N = 25 adults).

Previous research identified two factors driving this effect: the accuracy of individual assessments and the diversity of opinions. Most available strategies to enhance the wisdom of crowds have focused on improving individual accuracy while neglecting the potential of increasing opinion diversity. Here, we study a complementary approach to reduce collective error by promoting erroneous divergent opinions. This strategy proposes to anchor half of the crowd to a small value and the other half to a large value before eliciting and averaging all estimates.

Computational decision-making research commonly assumes that expectations do not drift within trials, yet it is unclear whether expectations pessimistically drift in real-world, high-stakes settings, what factors influence expectation drift, and whether it effectively buffers emotional responses to goal-relevant outcomes. Moreover, individuals learn from PEs to accurately anticipate future outcomes, but it is unknown whether expectation drift also impedes PE-based learning. In a sample of students awaiting exam grades (N = 625), we found that expectations often drift and tend to drift pessimistically.

A preregistered accuracy-based b-CFS experiment showed higher localization accuracy for suppressed probable (versus improbable) objects under identical presentation durations, thereby excluding the possibility of processing differences emerging after conscious access (e.g., criterion shifts).

Because temporally predictable events repeat over days, weeks, and years, we must maintain—and potentially transform—memories of temporal structure to support adaptive behavior. We explored how individuals build durable models of temporal regularities to guide multistep anticipation. Healthy young adults (Experiment 1: N = 99, age range = 18–40 years; Experiment 2: N = 204, age range = 19–40 years) learned sequences of scene images that were predictable at the category level and contained incidental perceptual details. Individuals then anticipated upcoming scene categories multiple steps into the future, immediately and at a delay. Consolidation increased the efficiency of anticipation, particularly for events further in the future, but diminished access to perceptual features. Further, maintaining a link-based model of the sequence after consolidation improved anticipation accuracy. Consolidation may therefore promote efficient and durable models of temporal structure, thus facilitating anticipation of future events.","2024-10-01","2025-07-15 03:28:39","2025-09-10 13:55:21","2025-07-15 03:28:39","1178-1199","","10","35","","Psychol Sci","","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\XUA977D3\Tarder-Stoll 等 - 2024 - Consolidation Enhances Sequential Multistep Anticipation but Diminishes Access to Perceptual Feature.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we adopted a central focused-attention task that contained peripheral target-matching distractors to investigate this issue (N = 51 adults). Surprisingly, we revealed that target-matching distractors elicited both a larger N2-posterior-contralateral (N2pc) and a larger post-N2pc distractor positivity (PD) component in high-capacity individuals than in low-capacity ones, meaning that high-capacity individuals are less able to ignore such distractors initially, though they could call on a stronger reactive suppression mechanism afterward.

We observed a strong Euclidean bias during the path-integration task on the spherical surface, even among participants who possessed knowledge of non-Euclidean geometry.

Across two experiments (N = 240 adults, recruited via Prolific), cash-out availability increased participants’ bet amounts by up to 35%.

Learners might effectively be told when (and when not) to assume that word meanings are mutually exclusive. In three experiments (N = 106 from across the United States; ages 2 years, 0 months−2 years, 11 months), we show that 2-year-olds only assumed that novel words have distinct meanings if the words were spoken with focus, an information-structural marker of contrast.

The benefits of considering both narrative identity and dispositional personality traits as they jointly apply to mental health are discussed.","2024-12-01","2025-07-15 03:30:23","2025-09-10 13:55:47","2025-07-15 03:30:13","1325-1339","","12","35","","Psychol Sci","Narrative Identity, Traits, and Trajectories of Depression and Well-Being","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\PMGLS8NV\Lind 等 - 2024 - Narrative Identity, Traits, and Trajectories of Depression and Well-Being A 9-Year Longitudinal Stu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to this explanation, participants performing the AMP would simplify the task by asking whether the target is pleasant (yes vs. no) and would use the affective information provided by the prime to answer the question (positive = yes, negative = no). In line with this proposition, we observed in three preregistered experiments that slightly modifying the response options proposed in the task moderated the effect, which can be canceled (Experiment 1) and even reversed (Experiments 2 and 3). These results are consistent with the informational explanation and seem difficult to explain by the operation of misattribution processes.","2024-12-01","2025-07-15 03:30:23","2025-09-10 13:55:51","2025-07-15 03:30:15","1340-1349","","12","35","","Psychol Sci","The Affect Misattribution Procedure Revisited","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\2EY4BQMQ\Pillaud和Ric - 2024 - The Affect Misattribution Procedure Revisited An Informational Account.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show experimentally that the top-down expectation of changes in natural scenes causes clearly distinguishable gaze behavior for visually identical scenes. We present free-viewing eye-tracking data of 20 healthy adults on a new video dataset of natural scenes, each mapped for its potential for change (PfC) in independent ratings. Observers looking at frozen videos looked significantly more often at the parts of the scene with a high PfC compared with static images, with substantially higher interobserver coherence. This viewing difference peaked right before a potential movement onset. Established concepts like object animacy or salience alone could not explain this finding. Images thus conceal experience-based expectations that affect gaze behavior in the potentially dynamic real world.","2024-12-01","2025-07-15 03:30:23","2025-09-10 13:55:55","2025-07-15 03:30:17","1350-1363","","12","35","","Psychol Sci","","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\TX99QZB4\Roth 等 - 2024 - Gaze Behavior Reveals Expectations of Potential Scene Changes.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the percentage of singles is steadily increasing, with more people staying single for life. We used the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE; N = 77,064, mainly ≥ 50 years, 27 countries) to investigate Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction in lifelong singles compared with ever-partnered individuals. Specification-curve analyses suggested that lifelong singles were less extraverted, less conscientious, less open to experiences (dependent on singlehood definition), and less satisfied with their lives. Effects were stronger for never-partnered than for never-cohabitating or never-married individuals and were partly moderated by gender, age, country-level singlehood, and gender ratio. Our study provides insights into the characteristics of lifelong singles and has implications for understanding mental health and structures of social support in older individuals.","2024-12-01","2025-07-15 03:30:23","2025-09-10 13:56:00","2025-07-15 03:30:19","1364-1381","","12","35","","Psychol Sci","","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\9SZDQN6H\Stern 等 - 2024 - Differences Between Lifelong Singles and Ever-Partnered Individuals in Big Five Personality Traits a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theories and existing research provide conflicting answers to this question, partly because the temporal processes and conditions under which different aspects of well-being are affected are unknown. Here, we used longitudinal data from Dutch, German, and Australian representative panels (281,884 observations, 28,663 caregivers) to examine theoretically derived hypotheses about changes in caregivers’ life satisfaction, affective experiences, depression/anxiety, and loneliness. Overall, results provided evidence for negative well-being effects after the transition into a caregiver role, with more pronounced and longer-lasting well-being losses in women than in men. We further found that well-being losses were larger with more time spent on caregiving, in both men and women. These results were robust across moderators of the caregiving context (care tasks, relationship with care recipient, and full-time employment). Together, the present findings support predictions of stress theory and highlight lingering questions in theoretical frameworks of care-related well-being costs.","2024-12-01","2025-07-15 03:30:23","2025-09-10 13:50:07","2025-07-15 03:30:21","1382-1394","","12","35","","Psychol Sci","","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\PQ6ZF3V7\Krämer和Bleidorn - 2024 - The Well-Being Costs of Informal Caregiving.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show using both vignettes (Study 1) and live interactions (Study 2) that unresponsive advice (vs. responsive questions) from men negatively affected women’s self-perceptions, leaving them feeling less respected, powerful, and trusting and having a smaller size of self. The advice giver’s gender did not moderate these self-perception outcomes (Study 3), although women anticipated greater stereotype threat only when men, and not when women, gave them unresponsive advice. Similar effects were found using responsive advice instead of questions as the comparison condition (Study 4). Overall, these findings (N = 4,394 U.S. adult women) suggest that it is the unresponsive nature of advice—and for certain outcomes the advice giver’s gender—that explain its effects on women. They point to the value of a responsive suggestion or question during conversations, particularly during cross-gender ones.","2024-12-01","2025-07-15 03:30:23","2025-09-10 13:56:06","2025-07-15 03:30:23","1395-1415","","12","35","","Psychol Sci","*Is Mansplaining Gendered?","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\K4JCGXSR\Santoro和Markus - 2024 - Is Mansplaining Gendered The Effects of Unsolicited, Generic, and Prescriptive Advice on U.S. Wome.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sex differences in intraindividual strengths are associated with educational and occupational sex disparities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Paradoxically, these sex differences are larger in more gender-equal countries, but the stability of this paradox is debated. We assessed the stability of the gender-equality paradox in intraindividual strengths, and its relation to wealth, by analyzing the academic achievement of nearly 2.5 million adolescents across 85 countries and regions in five waves (from 2006 to 2018) of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Girls’ intraindividual strength in reading and boys’ strength in mathematics and science were stable across countries and waves. Boys’ advantage in science as an intraindividual strength was larger in more gender-equal countries, whereas girls’ advantage in reading was larger in wealthier countries. The results have implications for reducing sex disparities in STEM fields.","2024-11","2025-08-17 05:38:09","2025-09-10 13:41:46","2025-08-17 05:38:09","1246-1259","","11","35","","Psychol Sci","The Gender-Equality Paradox in Intraindividual Academic Strengths","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\RYU8ZXZT\Balducci 等 - 2024 - The Gender-Equality Paradox in Intraindividual Academic Strengths A Cross-Temporal Analysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
