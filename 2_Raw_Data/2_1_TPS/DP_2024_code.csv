In Study 1, 48 children ages 6–15 answered questions about how they discovered Santa was not real and how the discovery made them feel, and 44 of their parents shared their perspectives and how they promoted Santa. In Study 2, 383 adults reflected on their experiences shifting to disbelief in Santa Claus. In both studies, the average age of disbelief was around 8, but with significant variability. Most participants reported testimony from others contributed to their disbelief, and some reported skepticism as a result of either experience (e.g., observation) or logical reasoning. About a third of children and half of adults reported some negative emotions upon discovering the truth. Higher levels of parental Santa promotion were associated with experiencing some negative emotions upon discovering the truth in both studies. Additionally, adults who reported feeling only negative emotions tended to be older when they discovered the truth, more likely to have reported learning the truth abruptly, and more likely to have reported learning the truth through testimony. That said, experiences of negative emotions were generally short-lived, and the vast majority of both children and adults reported they would celebrate Santa with their own children or were already doing so. Implications of these findings for how to approach children’s transition to skepticism regarding Santa are discussed, including timing, the role of parents, and popular notions of discovery for children’s trust toward their parents.

Could this tendency be countered by teaching children more valid strategies for judging possibility? We explored this question by training children aged 4–12 (n = 128) to consider either the similarity between the target event and unusual events that have actually occurred or causal mechanisms that might bring the target event about. Both trainings increased children’s acceptance of improbable events but only for the types of events addressed during training. Older children were more likely to accept improbable events, as were children who scored higher on a measure of cognitive reflection, but neither age nor cognitive reflection moderated the effects of training. These findings indicate that children can use both similarity and causality to assess possibility, but the use of this information is highly circumscribed, further demonstrating how robustly children conflate improbability with impossibility.

Internally and externally motivated moral identity was assessed on varying levels of abstractness for promotion orientation as well as prevention orientation in Canadian participants from three different age groups: early adolescence (13–14 years, n = 248, 119 female), late adolescence to early adulthood (17–20 years, n = 251, 160 female), and mid to old age (50–76 years, n = 129, 76 female). Findings demonstrate that the self-importance of abstract moral identity characteristics increased with age relative to concrete identity characteristics, while the relationship between the two characteristics weakened. The same trend was found for internal moral identity motivation in comparison to external motivation. The study demonstrates that moral identity does not only reflect stable individual differences but is also an important developmental construct. Merging developmental and individual difference perspectives on moral identity opens new and promising avenues for future research.

Global control (i.e., overall perceived control) decreases over time in studies following people every few years to upwards of 10 years. Changes across wider intervals of the lifespan, however, have yet to be examined. Further, how perceived control changes for specific aspects of daily life, such as stressors, remains comparatively less clear. Using data from the Midlife in the United States National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE, N = 1,940, M = 56.25 years, SD = 12.20, 57% female), we examined longitudinal changes in global control across 20 years and daily stressor control across 10 years. Global control was assessed in the first wave of the NSDE (∼1996). In follow-up waves, conducted in ∼2008 and ∼2017, participants again not only reported their global control but also reported their perceived control over stressors they experience across 8 consecutive days. Longitudinal analyses revealed differential change trajectories for global control across 20 years and stressor control across 10 years (ps < .001). Global control declined for younger and older adults but stayed relatively stable for individuals in midlife. The rate of decline in daily stressor control was steeper than the decline in global control and did not vary by age at baseline. In addition, declines were amplified among individuals with higher global control at baseline. Results suggest that daily stressor control is a specific aspect of control beliefs that follows a different rate of change than global control.

We took advantage of a unique and comprehensive longitudinal design, which included 12 waves of data, both quantitative and qualitative assessments, collected over 4 years, on two distinct college campuses in the Northwestern and Northeastern regions of the United States (Wave 1, n = 639; growth models using all waves, n = 251). Analyses for this study were preregistered after data collection was complete. We first examined trajectories of exploration and commitment via the dual-cycle identity model. Second, we examined whether exploratory processing in the narration of future self-defining memories at specific waves predicted changes in exploration and commitment in subsequent waves. Findings indicated that exploration and commitment showed trajectories typically viewed as normative (e.g., increasing adaptive forms of exploration and commitment), although trajectories for those at higher socioeconomic statuses differed by showing more exploration and less commitment. We failed to find evidence that exploratory processing predicted changes in exploration and commitment. Implications include distinctions in measurement and theoretical approaches to the study of identity development, the need for greater understanding of what is developing before theorizing how it develops, and the limitations of what is considered normative without attention to structural constraints, such as social class.

With some older adults reconsidering the relevance of purpose later in life, the measurement of purpose may suffer from variance issues with age. The current study investigated whether sense of purpose functions similarly across ages and evaluated if the predictive power of purpose on mental, physical, cognitive, and financial outcomes changes when accounting for a less age-affected measurement structure. Utilizing data from two nationwide panel studies (Health and Retirement Study: n = 14,481; Midlife in the United States: n = 4,030), the current study conducted local structural equation modeling and found two factors for the positively and negatively valenced purpose items in the Purpose in Life subscale (Ryff, 1989), deemed the purposeful and purposeless factor. These factors become less associated with each other at higher ages. When reproducing past findings with this two-factor structure, the current study found that the purposeful and purposeless factors predicted these outcomes in the same direction as would be suggested by past research, but the magnitude of these effects differed for some outcomes. The discussion focuses on the implications of what this means for our understanding of sense of purpose across the lifespan.

Our knowledge of how friendships develop over time, especially from childhood through adulthood, is limited. Furthermore, it is now recognized that this specific type of relationship influences health across the life course in unique ways. Using the Convoy Model of Social Relations as a guiding framework, this study charts the multiple and unique trajectories of friendship across adulthood and tests whether these trajectories influence health differentially by age. The sample for the study consisted of 553 adults from the longitudinal Social Relations Study. Respondents ranged in age from 13 to 77 at Wave 1 (1992), and included only those who reported a best friend in each wave, that is, Wave 2 (2005) and Wave 3 (2015). Approximately 65% of the respondents were women, and 24.5% were people of color. Latent growth curve analysis identified three trajectories of the presence of friends in one’s network over time, two trajectories of positive friend quality, and three for negative quality. The most consistent findings are associated with positive friend relations over time. Gender was associated with friendship quality where women reported more positive friend relations over time, and increasing positive friend relations predicted better health 23 years later. These findings demonstrate that consistent and increasing positive friendships yield health benefits over time, whereas the presence of friends and negative quality does not have an effect. Overall, findings advance understanding of the long-term effects of social relations across the lifespan and life course.

However, seeing static faces does not represent infants’ typical experience of the social world, which involves people in motion and performing actions. Here, we assessed infants’ looking preferences for native over foreign language speakers in two social contexts: the presentation of static faces and the presentation of people performing instrumental actions. In addition, we tested infants’ preferential looking at 5 and 9 months of age to assess whether their pattern of preferential looking changes across development. The results of 5-month-old infants replicated and extended previous findings by showing that, at this age, infants typically look longer at people who previously spoke their native language. As found for other social categories such as race and gender, this familiarity-based looking preference was not evident at 9 months of age when infants were presented with static faces. However, when presented with more informative dynamic events, 9-month-old infants showed a temporally aligned preference for the native over the foreign language speaker. Specifically, infants’ looking preference was time-locked to the completion of the action goal: when speakers grasped and lifted a toy. These results suggest potentially a familiarity-based preference toward native language speakers around 5 months of age, which may later develop into a more strategic selective response in service of information-seeking.

When the talker spoke in the children’s native language, monolinguals attended equally to the eyes and mouth throughout the trial, whereas close-language bilinguals first attended more to the mouth and then distributed attention equally between the eyes and mouth. In contrast, when the talker spoke in a nonnative language (English), both monolinguals and bilinguals initially attended more to the mouth and then gradually shifted to a pattern of equal attention to the eyes and mouth.

At 6-month intervals, caregivers reported on toddlers’ Spanish and English words produced as well as their language exposure at home. Video recordings at child age 18 months yielded estimates of toddlers’ speech output (word tokens per minute). In addition, at child age 18 months, caregivers reported on toddlers’ linguistic skills (comprehension), demographic background (gender, household income), and nonverbal behaviors (gesture production). Results showed that toddlers were exposed to both English and Spanish and received more Spanish than English from primary caregivers; there were no significant primary caregiver input differences across time. Growth modeling revealed linear growth rates for Spanish and conceptual (Spanish, English combined) vocabulary and a curvilinear trajectory for English vocabulary. Furthermore, toddlers’ Spanish and conceptual vocabularies were positively associated with their higher frequencies of token use, greater production of gesture, and greater comprehension skills, even after controlling for input. Moreover, Spanish and conceptual growth rates were positively associated with higher token use. In terms of English, toddlers’ vocabulary at child age 18 months was positively associated with their comprehension skills. Toddlers’ use of more gestures and tokens as well as gender (boys) influenced their English acceleration rates over time. Findings indicate that unique trajectories exist for each of a bilingual’s languages and these trajectories are differentially influenced by child-level factors, including their speech output, not only exposure to language.

This demographic shift calls for a reevaluation of the impact of household size on children’s development. Household density (HHD), measured as the ratio of people to bedrooms in a home, has been shown to negatively relate to children’s language. Here, we propose that while greater HHD may result in poorer language abilities, more adults in relation to the number of children in the home may have a positive impact on children’s language. To test this hypothesis, we studied relations between HHD and adult-to-child ratio with children’s vocabulary scores, as well as whether maternal education and household chaos accounted for these associations. Participants included families from a range of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds (N = 275; Mage = 10.85; 51% female; 51% Hispanic; annual income range less than $10,000–over $100,000). In general, higher HHD was related to lower child vocabulary scores. Conversely, higher adult-to-child ratio was related to higher child vocabulary and lower household chaos. These patterns were primarily driven by effects in Hispanic families. Our results suggest that a reevaluation of household size is needed, as more adults in the home can be protective for children’s language development in larger families, an effect that may vary by culture.

However, the available empirical evidence is inconsistent, leading to substantial uncertainty regarding the cross-lagged relations between SA and SR. This meta-analysis systematically integrates data from 107 longitudinal studies, comprising 110 independent samples and involving a total of 115,133 participants from childhood to adulthood. Four types of SR were assessed: family-related, school-related, romantic, and general relationships. One-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling was applied to fit four cross-lagged panel models and to test potential moderators. No significant publication bias was detected. Effect size analyses revealed that prior SA significantly and negatively predicted quality of all types of SR. Family-related and general relationships each predicted prospective SA symptoms, but school-related and romantic relationships did not. No moderators were identified in analyses of family-related and romantic relationships. However, the publication year, sample age, gender, reporter, and time lag played a moderating role in analyses of school-related and general relationships. These findings suggest that SA is a crucial factor undermining SR and that dysfunctional family and general relationships also contribute to the exacerbation of SA symptoms. The strengths, limitations, and future directions of this study are discussed.

Exploring maternal and child perceptions of children’s anxiety longitudinally","Developmental Psychology","","1939-0599","10.1037/dev0001646","","The goals of this study were to investigate (a) the dyadic relations of mothers’ and children’s perceptions of children’s anxiety symptoms across development, (b) whether maternal perceptions of children’s anxiety serve as a mediator of the association between maternal anxiety and child anxiety, and (c) whether sensitive/structured parenting moderates these processes. Participants were 180 mother–child dyads (96 female) recruited from Quebec, Canada, and assessed in preschool, middle childhood, and early adolescence. Mothers and children completed questionnaires on children’s anxiety, and mothers additionally completed a questionnaire on their own anxiety. Maternal sensitivity/structuring was assessed from an observed interaction task. Results from an actor–partner interdependence model suggest (a) maternal perceptions of children’s anxiety in middle childhood predict children’s self-perceptions in adolescence, but not vice versa; (b) maternal perceptions in middle childhood mediate the link between maternal anxiety in early childhood and child self-perceptions of anxiety in adolescence; and (c) the indirect effect of maternal perceptions is moderated by maternal sensitivity/structuring such that mothers who perceived more anxiety in their children and who were observed to show lower levels of sensitivity/structuring in middle childhood tended to have children who perceived more anxiety in adolescence. Findings suggest that maternal awareness of children’s anxiety may be one mechanism, in the presence of relationships characterized by lower levels of sensitivity, through which anxiety risk is transferred from parent to child over time.

Components of socioeconomic status (SES) associate with differences in brain structure and psychiatric risk across the lifespan. This study aimed to investigate the influence of SES on brain aging in childhood and adolescence, a period of rapid neurodevelopment and peak onset for many psychiatric disorders. We reanalyzed data from the Healthy Brain Network to examine the influence of SES components (occupational prestige, public assistance enrollment, parent education, and household income-to-needs ratio [INR]) on relative brain age (RBA). Analyses included 470 youth (5–17 years; 61.3% men), self-identifying as White (55%), African American (15%), Hispanic (9%), or multiracial (17.2%). Household income was 3.95 ± 2.33 (mean ± SD) times the federal poverty threshold. RBA quantified differences between chronological age and brain age using covariation patterns of morphological features and total volumes. We also examined associations between RBA and psychiatric symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]). Models covaried for sex, scan location, and parent psychiatric diagnoses. In a linear regression, lower RBA is associated with lower parent occupational prestige (p = .01), lower public assistance enrollment (p = .03), and more parent psychiatric diagnoses (p = .01), but not parent education or INR. Lower parent occupational prestige (p = .02) and lower RBA (p = .04) are associated with higher CBCL anxious/depressed scores. Our findings underscore the importance of including SES components in developmental brain research. Delayed brain aging may represent a potential biological pathway from SES to psychiatric risk.

Studying the role of culture in development requires information about participants’ demographic backgrounds. However, both reporting and treatment of demographic data are limited and inconsistent in child development research. A barrier to reporting demographic data in a consistent fashion is that no standardized tool currently exists to collect these data. Variation in cultural expectations, family structures, and life circumstances across communities make the creation of a unifying instrument challenging. Here, we present a framework to standardize demographic reporting for early child development (birth to 3 years of age), focusing on six core sociodemographic construct categories: biological information, gestational status, health status, community of descent, caregiving environment, and socioeconomic status. For each category, we discuss potential constructs and measurement items and provide guidance for their use and adaptation to diverse contexts. These items are stored in an open repository of context-adapted questionnaires that provide a consistent approach to obtaining and reporting demographic information so that these data can be archived and shared in a more standardized format.

Using data from over 4,000 EMA samples from N = 62 infants recruited from across the United States and sampled longitudinally, we measured changes in the base rates of different activities in daily life. With age, infants spent more time unrestrained. With the onset of walking, infants spent less time sitting and prone and more time upright. Although rates of object holding did not change with age or walking ability, we found that infants who can walk hold objects more often in an upright position compared with nonwalkers. We discuss how accurately measuring changes in lived experiences serves to constrain theories about developmental mechanisms.

Because societal and cultural practices are dynamic, this exploratory study examined whether the ages at which infants typically learned to crawl, cruise, and walk changed over the past 3 decades. We compiled archival data from 1,306 infants born between January 31, 1992, and December 10, 2021. Parents originally reported milestone onsets in interviews and by using diaries. For each motor milestone, a linear regression model predicted the onset age using birth date. Segmented regression analyses inspected changes in slopes over time. Covariates included rural/urban housing, gestation age, season of birth, and birth weight. Infants’ average crawling, cruising, and walking onset ages changed over time. After controlling for the covariates, infants’ crawling onset age steadily increased until 2012, after which crawling onset age decreased. Infants’ cruising onset age increased from 1991 to 2001, after which cruising onset age remained stable. After controlling for the covariates, infants’ walking onset increased until 2015, after which walking onset age decreased. Thus, when infants were born explained a small but significant amount of variability in infant motor skill onset. While the current study showed that motor development changed over the years, motor development is just a model system for development more generally: Cohort effects may be pervasive across developmental domains. Using motor development as a model system for studying change suggests that generational effects due to a changing society may be pervasive across developmental domains.

In separate sessions, participants identified the emotional content of the music or reported on the feelings elicited by the music clip, with above-chance accuracy. Emotion recognition was associated with age and higher levels of child emotional verbal expressivity. Children with higher parent-reported empathy reported greater resonance with the emotion conveyed by music, specifically for sad music. Recognition and resonance were correlated (i.e., alignment), although the relationship varied as a function of the emotion expressed, with the greatest alignment for sad music. Results provide insights into emotion recognition and resonance in the absence of direct social signals and provide evidence that children’s ability to recognize and resonate with emotion differs depending on characteristics of the music and the child.

Although there is empirical support for the risk potentiation model, most studies have been restricted to parent report of children’s outcomes and do not consider the influence of shyness and inhibitory control on other children’s social behavior. In the present study, we used an actor–partner interdependence model to examine whether shyness and inhibitory control at Time 1 (N = 105, 52 girls, Mage = 3.50 years; 87% White; Mincome = between $75,000 and $100,000 in Canadian dollars) predicted children’s own and their partner’s observed social behavior with an unfamiliar peer at Time 2 (Mage = 4.76 years). When the child’s own inhibitory control was high, the child’s own shyness was negatively associated with their own approach behaviors but negatively associated with their partner’s avoidance behaviors. However, when the child’s own inhibitory control was low, the child’s own shyness was unrelated to their own approach behaviors but positively associated with their partner’s avoidance behaviors. Although inhibitory control was negatively associated with approach-related behavior for some shy children, this did not translate to more avoidance from the social partner. These results highlight the importance of examining the child’s own behavior in addition to their partner’s behavior when considering children’s socioemotional development.

Inhibited children are more likely to display social withdrawal and experience an increased risk for internalizing problems. Trait inference, the way children interpret behaviors and infer the characteristics of others, may be one potential mechanism. The current study examined the individual differences of BI in trait inference using a cross-sectional design (Study 1, Age 4, N = 80, 38 boys, Chinese) and explored the role of trait inference (Age 4) in relation to early BI (Age 2) and later internalizing behaviors (Age 4) using a longitudinal design (Study 2, N = 163, 93 boys). Trait inference was measured by children’s personality judgments after watching four pieces of behavioral information of animated actors in two conditions: a high positive information condition and a high negative information condition. We found that high BI children exhibited a more negative trait inference than low BI children did in two studies, except for the trait inference in the high negative information condition of Study 2. Besides, in Study 2, trait inference in the high positive information condition partially mediated the BI-internalizing behavior link, and such mediation effect was moderated by the level of trait inference. These findings highlight the contribution of social information processing in the social adjustment of children with extreme temperament and have implications for prevention and intervention.

Overall, mothers contingently responded to infant distress, and mothers’ responses to infant distress increased the likelihood of infant soothing in real time.

Our long-term goal is to determine the causal structure underlying associations between early environmental conditions and later psychosocial and health outcomes. Our overall objective in this study was to further evaluate predictions derived from applications of life history theory to female reproductive development, key among them that reproductive milestones translate early environmental risk into fertility, health, and behavioral outcomes. To this end, we used female data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and structural equation modeling to conduct increasingly severe tests, beginning with covariate control and then progressing to sibling control and behavioral genetic designs. After adjusting for confounds varying between sets of siblings, we did not find evidence that age at menarche reflected components of early environment or that any focal outcomes reflected early fragmented family structure (birth to age nine). Although we detected no links between measured environment and individual differences in age at sexual debut, we did find that it reflected both shared and nonshared influences in our behavior genetic models. Interestingly, delayed sexual debut (into young adulthood) reflected identification of parents as the greatest influences and forecasted an array of fertility-related outcomes. Taken together, these findings challenge theories suggesting menarche timing is adaptively calibrated to early environment. They also highlight the need for more research using sibling control and related designs to examine the roles of environments in development.

Results revealed that earlier perceived timing predicted higher subsequent depressive symptoms in girls with low (B = .40, SE = .15) but not high (B = −.08, SE = .17) levels of engagement coping suggestions, whereas earlier perceived timing predicted higher subsequent depressive symptoms in boys with high (B = .40, SE = .17) but not low (B = −.12, SE = .15) levels of engagement coping suggestions. These findings build on prior theory and research by highlighting that maternal coping suggestions may mitigate or enhance depression risk in youth who perceive themselves as early maturers; the differential effects in girls and boys suggest that the impact of these suggestions may depend on whether they are in line with gender-specific norms for coping.

Results indicated that families who experienced job loss tended to report higher levels of health stress and financial stress, which in turn was associated with heightened negative affect and poorer sleep quality for both parents and adolescents. When parents work from home (WFH), families tended to have lower levels of health stress and financial stress, which in turn weakened the positive links with negative affect and sleep quality. Lower- (vs. higher-) income families experienced weaker protective effects associated with WFH arrangements.

Our final sample was composed of 652 healthy French adults aged from 18 to 97 years, divided into four age groups: young adults (n = 163, M = 23.7 years), middle-aged adults (n = 135, M = 44.0 years), young-old adults (n = 178, M = 64.5 years), and old-old adults (n = 176, M = 79.6 years). Participants were asked to recollect three SDMs. A similar pattern of thematic content was observed throughout adulthood, except for relationship narratives were more frequent in the two younger groups. The findings highlighted that specific and integrated SDMs decreased with age and that tension and contaminative sequences were the most frequent in young adults. Redemptive memories did not significantly differ whatever the age of participants. No clear positivity effect was observed with aging. Finally, an analysis of the correlations among the main SDMs’ dimensions showed that specificity correlated positively with tension in young adults and integrative meaning with redemption in young and middle-aged participants. We found no significant correlation between specificity and integration in any age group. For the first time, this study sheds new light on lifelong identity adjustments.

However, it is critical to understand for whom these activities may be most beneficial. In two studies, we examine the extent to which foundational cognitive skills moderate the effects of playing math games on math skills. In Study 1, we look cross-sectionally at the association between parents’ frequency of math activities with their 3- to 4-year-old children (N = 124) and children’s math achievement, examining the extent to which children’s skills moderate this relation. We find that frequent math activities are only associated with better math performance for children with better number knowledge. In Study 2, we test this experimentally by randomly assigning parents and children (N = 76) to play with a number-related board game, an active control board game, or a business-as-usual control group. Controlling for number knowledge, inhibitory control, and vocabulary at pretest, no differences in math skills at posttest were observed between the training groups. However, a significant interaction emerged between training group assignment and number knowledge, such that children with higher pretest number knowledge had higher posttest math scores when assigned to the number board game condition compared to the two control conditions, but no differences among conditions were seen for children with lower number knowledge. Collectively, these findings suggest that math activities may be most beneficial for math skills when children have stronger number knowledge and underscore the need for tailoring activities to children’s current skill level.

Here, we examine whether simply mentioning the math or spatial relevance of a task affects children’s performance and the moderating role of children’s math and spatial attitudes. Further, we examine gender differences in performance given pervasive gender gaps in STEM and early-emerging gender differences in math and spatial attitudes. Participants (221 first- to fourth-grade children from the United States; 113 girls, 108 boys; 52% White, 16% Black, 14% Asian, 9% Hispanic or Latinx, 18% multiple races/ethnicities) were introduced to a novel task framed as tapping into math or spatial abilities (or no framing [control condition]). Children then completed math and spatial anxiety and self-concept measures. Results indicate that children who heard the math task framing were less accurate relative to children in the control condition, and the effect was larger for those with higher math anxiety or lower math self-concept, but it was not different for boys and girls. Children who heard the spatial task framing, however, performed comparably to children in the control condition. Though both math and spatial attitudes revealed identical patterns of gender differences (with higher anxiety and lower self-concept in girls than boys), there were no gender differences in performance. This study highlights the salient role of math attitudes early in development and provides key insights for future work aimed at increasing STEM outcomes.

It was unknown, however, whether these racial differences shifted in the months immediately following the summer of 2020 when there was heightened public attention directed toward white parents, specifically, to talk with children about racism. In the present study, we investigated whether and how Black (n = 344) and white (n = 381) parents talked about Black Lives Matter (BLM) with their 8- to 11-year-old children. Overall, 80% of parents (n = 725) reported talking about BLM, but Black parents were significantly more likely to discuss BLM than white parents (p = .008). Further qualitative analysis of the content of parents’ reports showed that Black parents were significantly more likely than white parents to provide responses about BLM that acknowledge racial inequality in society or explicitly affirm/support Black lives. White parents, in contrast, were significantly more likely to discuss BLM by focusing on equality but without acknowledging racial injustice or to provide responses that lacked clarity and/or substance. Using the m(ai)cro model of human development (Rogers, Niwa, et al., 2021), we discuss how parents’ reported race conversations are shaped by the sociopolitical context and their role in disrupting (or perpetuating) systemic racism through socialization.

Attachment research has been criticized because most studies have been conducted with Western populations. Critics argue this has (a) overemphasized the importance of sensitive responsive caregiving and (b) limited our understanding of multiple nonmaternal caregiving (allomothering). Here, we analyze the extent of sensitive responsiveness and structural properties of allomothering networks among Mbendjele hunter-gatherers who reside in the Republic of Congo. Humans lived as hunter-gatherers for the majority of our evolutionary history, thus studying contemporary hunter-gatherers can offer insight into the caregiving children may be psychologically adapted to. Based on 12-hr focal follows of 18 children (0–4 years old; 10 male), we constructed caregiving networks across the domains of responding to crying, physical contact, interactive care, and proximity. Crying was virtually always responded to rapidly via comforting and never via scolding. Children received physical contact and care for the majority of the day. Allomothering accounted for 40%–50% of caregiving in each domain. While allomaternal networks were large, they were highly concentrated—the majority of a child’s allocare was provided by just a few caregivers. Due to high caregiver:child ratios, “sharing” of caregivers was limited—a child typically had several allomothers who directed a majority of their allomaternal effort to him/her. These findings add to our understanding of the level and sources of sensitive responsive caregiving that children may be evolutionarily primed to expect.

Higher child EXT at 6 years predicted higher HP at 7–8 years, which predicted higher EXT at 9 years. Also, this path was moderated by 6-year child effortful control, 6-year resting RSA, and 9-year executive function. In contrast, there was no moderating effect of any measure of maternal regulation. Findings suggest it is important to consider child self-regulation when examining bidirectionality in parent and child effects for HP and child EXT.

One intervention, attachment and biobehavioral catch-up (ABC), was shown to successfully improve not only young foster children’s attachment to their parents, but also their receptive vocabulary skills (Bernard et al., 2017; Raby et al., 2019). Given that language acquisition is intricately linked to parents’ sensitive interactions with their children, we ask whether the ABC intervention also improves the quality of parents’ talk addressed to children. We test whether the ABC intervention results in more conversational turns between parents and their children. Crucially, we also look within these conversational turns, assessing the number and types of questions that parents ask children. Results suggest that parents who received the ABC intervention do not have more conversational turns or ask higher numbers of questions, compared to parents who received the control intervention. Rather, parents in the ABC group ask a higher proportion of child-led and restatement questions, and a lower proportion of parent-led and pedagogical questions, compared to the control. Additionally, the higher proportion of child-led questions were related to higher parental sensitivity scores. Together, these results suggest that an intervention originally designed to improve children’s socioemotional outcomes had positive benefits for the quality of conversations between parents and children.

It has been proposed that an important feature of an established self-concept (SC) is sufficient coherency in how one views oneself. Furthermore, the MSC is expected to develop into a multidimensional, hierarchical construct which is stable over time. Investigating these theoretical hypotheses, this study aims to take three aspects into account to get a deeper insight into when and how the MSC first emerges: emergence of coherency, stability, and a differentiated structure. Preschoolers were presented with a puppet-interview at two measurement points (T1: M = 4.21 years, T2: M = 5.43 years, N = 108–133; 51%–57% female, largely Caucasian). The interview comprises three moral (helping, sharing, comforting), a physical, and a verbal self-concept scale. To investigate whether children had an established SC and therefore answered coherently, we analyzed children’s response patterns resulting in a coherency-score: The greater answers vary within scales, the lower children score. Coherency of the MSC rose significantly across preschool period: At age 5, children answered largely coherently. Coherency of children’s MSC related to its stability, meaning that the MSC was mostly stable for children with high coherency at T1. Factor analysis confirmed a multidimensional structure of the MSC at age 5, but not at age 4. The results demonstrate that a coherent and differentiated MSC is acquired within the preschool period. This offers a new approach to investigate the emergence of the SC in early development by integrating the important aspect of coherency into the area of SC research.

Experiment 1a (N = 100 Scottish adults aged 18–72 years) assessed whether participants’ use of prosocial speech acts varied according to audience design considerations (i.e., whether or not the recipient of the news was directly affected). Experiment 1b (N = 100 Scottish adults aged 19–70 years) assessed whether participants adjusted for whether the bad news was more or less severe (an index of general knowledge). Younger adults displayed more flexible adaptation to the recipient manipulation, while no age differences were found for severity. These findings are consistent with prior work showing age-related decline in audience design but not in the use of general knowledge during language production. Experiment 2 further probed younger adults (N = 40, Scottish, aged 18–37 years) and older adults’ (N = 40, Scottish, aged 70–89 years) prosocial linguistic behavior by investigating whether health (vs. nonhealth-related) matters would affect responses. While older adults used prosocial speech acts to a greater extent than younger adults, they did not distinguish between conditions. Our results suggest that prosocial linguistic behavior is likely influenced by a combination of differences in audience design and communicative styles at different ages. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of situating prosocial speech acts within the pragmatics and aging literature, allowing us to uncover the factors modulating prosocial linguistic behavior at different developmental stages.

Children’s reasoning about socioeconomic status predicts inclusion and resource bias","Developmental Psychology","","1939-0599","10.1037/dev0001655","","Children’s socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to disparate access to resources and affects social behaviors such as inclusion and resource allocations. Yet it is unclear whether children’s essentialized view of SES (i.e., believing SES is immutable) or subjective social status (SSS) influences behavioral biases toward high- versus low-SES peers. We measured 4- to 9-year-old children’s SES essentialism and SSS to test whether these predict inclusion and resource allocations to high- versus low-SES peers (N = 127; from a midsize city in the Southeastern United States; 49.6% female; parent-reported 54.2% White, 2.8% Black, 8.3% Latine, 5.6% Asian, 1.4% another race, 27.8% multiracial, 43.3% not provided). We also compared children’s SES beliefs to their parent’s. Children’s SES essentialism and SSS decreased across the ages tested, and children reported higher SSS than their parents. Parents’ SES essentialism predicted younger (but not older) children’s SES essentialism. Moreover, SES essentialism mediated the negative relationship between age and preference for including high-SES peers, while SSS mediated the negative relationship between age and preference for allocating more resources to high-SES peers. This suggests that beliefs about the nature of SES may influence sociorelational behavior like including or excluding others, while perceived social status (SSS) may influence resource allocations. Furthermore, older children and those with lower SES essentialism included low- versus high-SES peers more often while older and lower SSS children distributed more resources toward low- versus high-SES peers. Thus, children’s SES essentialism and SSS may also influence their behaviors to either perpetuate or rectify inequality.

It is often assumed that peer victimization is associated with fewer psychological problems in classrooms where defending victims of bullying is common (i.e., a norm). The few studies testing this claim have been cross-sectional and have produced mixed findings. The current preregistered study examined whether the prospective link between victimization and psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms and self-esteem) was moderated by classroom defending norms. Moreover, we aimed to explain why defending norms may have either beneficial or adverse effects on victims’ adjustment, by focusing on two cognitive processes: victims’ causal attributions and social comparisons. Three waves of data were collected among 3,470 Finnish fourth- to ninth-grade students from 227 classrooms (Mage = 13.04, 50.1% girls). Multilevel regression analyses showed that nonvictimized youth benefited from high defending norms, whereas victims’ psychological adjustment did not vary as a function of defending norms. Therefore, no mediation analyses were conducted. Nonpreregistered additional analyses indicated that stable victims had greater psychological problems and higher self-blame over time in classrooms with higher defending norms. Thus, even though the majority of students seem to profit from defending norms, this might not be true for those who most urgently need help.

Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) provides a useful framework for understanding temperament and externalizing problems associations. During adolescence, oppositional problems are posited to be linked to an overactive behavioral approach system (BAS) while conduct problems are linked to an underactive behavioral inhibition system (BIS). However, this research mostly uses adult samples and cross-sectional designs and tests only between-person associations. Moreover, most studies typically test only one direction of effects (i.e., temperament predicts externalizing problems) and do not consider alternative models of associations, such as reciprocal associations. To address these limitations, we use three annual waves of a longitudinal, community-based sample of 387 early adolescents (mean Wave 1 age = 11.61 years, 55% female, 83% non-Hispanic White) to test reciprocal associations between BIS and BAS and oppositional and conduct problems. Latent curve models with structured residuals are used to test hypotheses and disaggregate between- and within-person associations. Evidence supports within-person reciprocal associations between BAS and oppositional problems and between BIS and combined conduct and oppositional problems. Results potentially inform developmental theories of temperament and externalizing problems linkages and interventions with adolescents who are engaging in oppositional problems and more severe conduct problems.

Reciprocated best friends were identified from friend nominations midway through the school year, at which time each partner described perceptions of social support and negativity in the relationship. Of the 363 reciprocated friend dyads, 26.2% (n = 95) were no longer friends 1–3 months later. Dyadic analyses were conducted with initial perceived friend negativity and initial perceived friend social support as predictors of subsequent friendship stability. When considered separately, perceived social support predicted self- and partner reports of friendship stability and perceived negativity predicted self- (but not partner) reports of friendship stability. In each case, lower initial social support and higher initial negativity predicted a greater incidence of friendship dissolution. When considered together, initial perceptions of social support predicted self- and partner reports of friendship dissolution, but perceptions of negativity predicted neither. The findings are consistent with those from married couples, which indicate that the absence of positive interactions is a stronger predictor of relationship instability than the presence of negative interactions.

Two groups of 24-month-olds (N = 64 and all White, tested in the United States) first listened to Italian sentences containing HTP and low-TP (LTP) words. We then used HTP and LTP words, and sequences that violated these statistics, in a mapping task. Infants learned HTP and LTP words equally well. They also learned LTP violations as well as LTP words, but learned HTP words better than HTP violations. Thus, by 2 years of age sensitivity to TPs does not lead to an HTP advantage but rather to poor mapping of violations of HTP word forms.

Importantly, parenting behavior appeared to modulate these effects, such that high parental nurturance buffered the effect of exposure to community violence on amygdala reactivity. These findings elucidate the potential impact of exposure to community violence on brain function and highlight the role parents can play in protecting youth from the neural effects of exposure to adversity.

We examined 1,030 six- to 11-year-olds (48.7% female; 82% White) twin pairs oversampled for neighborhood disadvantage from the Twin Study of Behavioral and Emotional Development in Children. We evaluated neighbor reports (N = 1,880) of neighborhood structural and social characteristics as moderators of genetic and environmental influences on children’s social processing. Although there was no evidence of moderation for children’s hostile attributions, there was robust evidence that the social and structural characteristics of the neighborhood moderated the genetic and environmental origins of children’s positive expectations of aggressive behavior. Specifically, we found that genetic influences on aggressive expectations increased in the presence of neighborhood deprivation and decreased in the presence of protective social processes and availability of resources. Such findings suggest that protective neighborhood social processes may buffer against the development of aggressive expectations during middle childhood by suppressing the expression of genetic influences on those outcomes. In doing so, they suggest that neighborhood social processes may be able to promote youth resilience to neighborhood deprivation “under the skin.” (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)","2024","2025-07-15 03:38:05","2025-07-29 12:31:58","","610-623","","4","60","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","APA PsycNet","","Place: US Publisher: American Psychological Association","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\CJ5CAIP7\Shewark 等 - 2024 - Neighborhood features moderate genetic and environmental influences on children’s social information.pdf","","","Twins; Social Cognition; Childhood Development; Neighborhoods; Genetics; Social Deprivation; Social Influences; Social Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing primarily on social identity theory (SIT), this study investigated how U.S. parents’ (N = 569) comfort with their children’s potential intergroup peer interactions (a) differed by child and peer group gender (boy, girl), race (Black, White), and social class (higher-, middle-, or lower-subjective social status), (b) changed over the transition from childhood to adolescence (8–10, 11–13, and 14–16 years), and (c) varied by context intimacy (hanging out vs. sleeping over). The sample was equally balanced between parents of children reflecting those same group memberships. Consistent with SIT, when asked to choose, parents were typically most comfortable with their child spending time with middle-class peers who shared their child’s gender and racial ingroup membership. Moreover, parents often explained their decisions with reference to similarities between these peers and their own child or family. Parents’ comfort did not differ systematically by child age, but many parents were less comfortable with cross-gender peer interactions in the more intimate sleepover context than the less intimate hangout context. All groups of parents also exhibited at least some openness to cross-group interactions. These findings advance developmental scientists’ understanding of parents’ roles as potential facilitators or gatekeepers of their children’s intergroup peer interactions.

A meta-analysis of the own-race bias","Developmental Psychology","","1939-0599","10.1037/dev0001721","","Adolescence is a critical developmental period that is marked by drastic changes in face recognition, which are reflected in patterns of bias (i.e., superior recognition for some individuals compared to others). Here, we evaluate how race is perceived during face recognition and whether adolescents exhibit an own-race bias (ORB). We conducted a Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate the summary effect size of the ORB across 16 unique studies (38 effect sizes) with 1,321 adolescent participants between the ages of ∼10–22 years of age. This meta-analytic approach allowed us to inform the analysis with prior findings from the adult literature and evaluate how well they fit the adolescent literature. We report a positive, small ORB (Hedges’s g = 0.24) that was evident under increasing levels of uncertainty in the analysis. The magnitude of the ORB was not systematically impacted by participant age or race, which is inconsistent with predictions from perceptual expertise and social cognitive theories. Critically, our findings are limited in generalizability by the study samples, which largely include White adolescents in White-dominant countries. Future longitudinal studies that include racially diverse samples and measure social context, perceiver motivation, peer reorientation, social network composition, and ethnic–racial identity development are critical for understanding the presence, magnitude, and relative flexibility of the ORB in adolescence.

Testing the predictive validity of school performance for outcomes in emerging adulthood","Developmental Psychology","","1939-0599","10.1037/dev0001548","","In putatively meritocratic societies, doing well in school is a pivotal precondition for accessing further and higher education, which, in turn, has a pervasive, long-term influence on adulthood development. Yet, doing well in school may also predict “real-life success” outside formal education settings and independent of the educational qualifications that a person attains. Such predictions are likely to become salient during emerging adulthood, a life period characterized by career explorations and social-emotional adjustment. Here, we tested the predictive validity of end-of-compulsory school grades at age 16 years in a U.K.-representative population cohort sample of up to N = 6,488, who were born between 1994 and 1996, for a broad range of occupational, financial, and social-emotional outcomes at age 23. End-of-compulsory school performance accounted for 1%–20% of the variance across occupational, financial, and social-emotional outcomes in emerging adulthood. Educational attainment attenuated these associations only slightly, with school grades at age 16 accounting for variance in emerging adulthood outcomes independent of later educational attainment. We found that school grades were equally predictive for boys’ and girls’ outcomes. In children from lower family socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, school grades were more predictive of their educational attainment, financial attitudes, and anxiety compared to higher SES children, with varying effect sizes (i.e., 0.3%–4.2%). Our findings suggest that school-leaving grades facilitate the successful transition from adolescence to adulthood, independent of educational attainment, and that they might enable children from low-SES families to compensate for some of their background disadvantages.

The relative role of cognitive and motivational parenting practices, however, is unclear given that the two types of practices have largely been studied in isolation. The current study simultaneously estimated the contributions of several cognitive and motivational parenting practices hypothesized to be important, but which may have overlapping effects. To capture parents’ cognitive practices, the level and structure (i.e., prompts vs. statements) of 529 American parents’ (80% mothers; 65% White, 20% Black; 33% less than a bachelor’s degree) numeracy talk was coded during a challenging numeracy activity. Parents’ motivational practices were assessed by coding their autonomy support and control in the activity. Children’s (Mage = 7.5 years; 49% girls) engagement of numeracy strategies was also coded. Multilevel minute-to-minute modeling predicting children’s engagement from both cognitive and motivational parenting practices indicated that parents’ cognitive practices, particularly advanced prompts, predicted children’s subsequent engagement of numeracy strategies, which were often advanced. Parents’ motivational practices, as reflected in their autonomy support (vs. control), also foreshadowed children’s engagement. These effects of the two types of practices were independent of one another. Taken together, the findings are consistent with the idea that cognitive and motivational parenting practices provide distinct resources that can benefit children’s math learning.

Findings based on the nationally representative high-school longitudinal study data (N = 12,070; Mage = 14 years; 54% female students; 28% first-generation college students; and 14% Latinx, 9% Black, 10% Asian, and 57% White) suggest that although adolescents’ math and science ability self-concepts declined during high school, their science interest remained stable, and their math and science utility values increased. Adolescents’ motivational beliefs in ninth grade and the changes from ninth to 11th grade positively predicted whether they declared a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college major. Parents’ ninth-grade STEM support was more consistently associated with adolescents’ concurrent beliefs compared to the changes in their beliefs. Finally, we found that female first-generation college students, who were more likely to be Latinx and Black students, tended to have lower math and science motivational beliefs, received less parental STEM support, and were less likely to choose a STEM major than their peers. The findings of this study indicate adolescents’ math and science motivational development in high school matters for their college majors and that certain understudied groups, including female first-generation college students, may experience acute marginalization in STEM and warrant further attention.

By conducting growth mixture modeling, we identified two classes of stable trajectories for expectancies for success; five classes of stable, decreasing, or increasing trajectories for interest and utility value; and three classes of stable, decreasing, or increasing trajectories for attainment value. The group comparisons demonstrated that variability exists in adolescents’ motivational belief development at the intersection of their race/ethnicity and gender for some trajectories. For example, Latina adolescents were more likely to maintain moderate expectancies for success than high expectancies for success compared to Latino and Asian male adolescents, but Asian female adolescents did not differ in their level of expectancies for success from the two male groups. Also, we found Latina adolescents displayed smaller decreases in interest compared to Asian female adolescents and in utility value compared to Latino adolescents. The findings from the present study challenge traditional stereotypes in math and highlight positive motivational belief development in students who are marginalized in math (e.g., Latina adolescents).

These skills can be challenging for both children and adults, especially in domains where they possess inaccurate prior beliefs that can interfere with the acquisition of correct scientific information (e.g., heavier objects fall faster than light ones). Across two experiments, we examined the additive benefit of combining explanations with guided activities to promote conceptual change. In Experiment 1 (N = 238), 4- and 5-year-olds were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: guidance with explanations, guidance only, or baseline. The guided conditions varied only in the presence or absence of conceptual information (i.e., explanation about gravity). Pre- and posttest measures showed that children’s predictions improved from both guided conditions compared to the baseline condition but did not significantly differ from each other. Experiment 2 (N = 80, 5-year-olds) included a delay test and assessed children’s learning through the justification of their predictions. Although children’s performance at the immediate posttest improved in both conditions, in the guidance only, children’s performance returned to the pretest levels of understanding after the delay. Children in the guidance with explanations condition had greater understanding at posttest, retained this understanding long term, and transferred it to objects with the same weight. These findings highlight the role of explanations in aiding children’s long-term learning from anomalous evidence in guided activities.

Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

Furthermore, we assessed the protective role of children’s early print experiences with books against the adverse effect of maternal depression on language development. Data for mothers and children (51.7% boys, 95% White, N = 11,662) were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Prenatal maternal depression held an adverse association with child language (β = −.16, p = .002). Moreover, the risk was greater for girls than boys (β = .19, p = .02). In addition, prenatal depression was significantly and negatively associated with child verbal intelligence quotient (β = −.11, p = .02) and performance intelligence quotient (β = −.12, p = .01). In contrast, postnatal depression or anxiety were not unique predictors of child outcomes. Importantly, children’s early experiences with books, as measured by the reported frequency of parent–child shared reading, moderated the negative association between maternal depression and child language development (β = .30, p < .001). Although modest in size, these findings inform models of child risk and resilience related to maternal psychopathology. The results also have implications for clinical programs as well as for prevention and intervention studies focusing on at-home early literacy.

Participants included 271 adolescent friend dyads (69 female and 69 male early adolescent dyads; 72 female and 61 male middle adolescent dyads; 66.4% White and 26.6% Black). The adolescents were observed discussing a problem with the friend and reported on depressive symptoms at the time of observation and 9 months later. Friends’ responses were coded into one of nine response type categories (i.e., four positive/engaged response types, one neutral response type, and four negative/disengaged response types). Actor–partner interdependence models revealed significant actor and partner effects for both positive and negative responses. Notably, receiving and/or producing positive/engaged responses, including saying something supportive, sharing related experiences, and asking questions, were associated with lower depressive symptoms over time. Receiving and/or producing negative/disengaged responses, including sharing one’s own experience in a distracting way, changing the subject, saying something unsupportive or minimizing the problem, and saying nothing at all heightened risk for depressive symptoms. Additionally, significant Actor × Partner interactions revealed that greater differences between the friends in the degree to which they produced supportive responses were associated with increased depressive symptoms and that both friends saying nothing at all was associated with increased depressive symptoms. When gender and grade differences were found, the associations typically were particularly strong for middle-adolescent girls. These results highlight the importance of attending to friends’ specific behaviors in social support contexts.

Yet many young adults in that situation avoid these problems. Close relationships are thought to be a key factor underpinning risk and resilience among this group. To examine this premise, this study explored links, beyond potential confounders assessed in adolescence, between strengths and strains in the social domain and markers of despair in the early and mid-20s in a Canadian sample overrepresenting youth without postsecondary credentials (N = 543, 52% male, 23% non-White). Having a good general ability to maintain supportive relationships was associated with fewer depressive and substance-related symptoms. Furthermore, support and less strain in relationships with parents and friends were associated with fewer depressive symptoms in the early and mid-20s, while for romantic relationships, associations with depressive symptoms became more consistent and robust in the mid-20s. Therefore, support and strains in romantic relationships gradually gained prominence as a determinant of depressive symptoms as youth advanced in adulthood. For substance-related problems, significant associations emerged for strains in friendships only, in both the early and mid-20s. These results suggest that multiple aspects of relationships pose a risk for or protect from the development of diseases of despair in early adulthood and that their relative importance changes depending on outcomes and developmental timing. Thus, facilitating meaningful social connections and reducing the prevalence and impact of relationship strains might contribute to preventing diseases of despair among youth with lower educational attainment.

Specifically, food insecurity may influence children through its effect on parents’ psychological well-being and parent–child interactions as a result, but past research on the role of parents is correlational and undermined by omitted variable bias. Using a partially rural, low-income sample of parents living in Pennsylvania (N = 272, 90% mother, Mage = 35) and their school-aged children (ages 4–11, 50% female) alongside daily measures of parent-reported food insecurity and parent and child mood and behavior, we examine how daily changes in food insecurity predict daily changes in parent and child well-being, and the extent to which food insecurity operates through parents to affect children. This method not only explores families’ daily, lived experiences of food insecurity, but improves upon the methodological issues undermining past research. Findings indicate that food insecurity influences parent and child well-being on a daily basis, but that associations are stronger and sustain longer for parents than children. Further, parent mood and behavior partially explain the association between daily food insecurity and child mood and behavior, but food insecurity is also independently associated with child well-being. This study is the first to examine daily associations between food insecurity and parent and child well-being. Its implications for food assistance programs, policies, and the future of food insecurity research are discussed.

Timing, nature, severity, and chronicity of adversity are thought to explain much of the variability in health and developmental outcomes among exposed individuals. The current study seeks to characterize heterogeneity in adverse experiences over time at the individual, family, and neighborhood domains in a cohort of predominantly Black children (85% Black and 15% White, 46.2% girls, 67.2% free/reduced lunch in first grade), and to examine associations with mental health from sixth grade to age 26. Participants were part of a randomized universal preventive interventions trial in first grade with prospective follow-up through early adulthood. Separate models characterized heterogeneity in adversity in elementary, middle, and high schools. Changes in adversity over time and relationships with mental health (anxiety, depression, suicidal behaviors) were investigated using a random-intercept latent transition analysis (RI-LTA). We identified three-class solutions in early childhood, middle school, and high school. Generally, both a higher and a lower poly-adversity class were observed at each time point, with varying nature of adversity characterized by the third class. RI-LTA indicated prevalent within-individual changes in adverse exposure over time and differential associations with mental health and suicidal behaviors. Results suggest that treating adverse exposures as a static construct may limit the ability to characterize salient variation over time. Identifying complexity in adverse experiences and their relation to health and well-being is key for developing and implementing effective prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate negative effects through the life course.

Adolescence provides an opportunity to understand how these experiences impact the brain’s rapidly changing structure. Two models are central to current adversity conceptualizations: a cumulative risk model, where all types of experiences are combined to represent accumulating stress, and a dimensional model, where certain features of experience (e.g., threat or deprivation) exert unique neurophysiological influence. In this registered report, we extended upon previous research by using a form of representational similarity analysis to examine whether the dimensional and cumulative risk models of adversity predict cortical thinning in frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks and volumetric changes in subcortical regions throughout adolescence. Drawing from a longitudinal sample of 179 adolescent girls (ages 10–13 years at the first wave) from Lane County, Oregon, United States, and up to four waves of follow-up data, we found that operationalizing adversity by similarity in threat and deprivation provided better prediction of brain development than similarity in overall adversity. However, these dimensions do not exhibit unique associations with developmental changes in the hypothesized brain changes. These results underscore the significance of carefully defining adversity and considering its impact on the entire brain.

One possibility is that the various predictors of parenting outlined by Belsky (1984; e.g., characteristics of the child, characteristics of the parent, and contextual influences) may matter more in some neighborhood contexts than in others. To examine this possibility, we conducted etiologic moderation analyses in a sample of 1,030 families of twins (average age 8 years; 51% male, 49% female; racial composition: 82% White, 10% Black, 1% Asian, 1% Indigenous, and 6% multiracial) from the Twin Study of Behavioral and Emotional Development in Children in the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Neighborhood and parenting were assessed using multiple informants and assessment strategies (neighborhood and family informants, administrative data, and videotaped parent–child interactions). Results pointed to strong evidence of etiologic moderation, such that child effects on positive mothering were prominent in neighborhoods with little opportunity and near zero in neighborhoods with ample opportunity. Such findings not only reframe the magnitude of child effects on the parenting they receive as context-dependent, but also indicate that mothers in impoverished neighborhoods may be more responsive to their children’s characteristics than mothers in neighborhoods with ample opportunity.

The present study examined short-delay (overnight) and long-delay (after a 2-week period) consolidation of new information either congruent or incongruent with prior knowledge in typically developing 6- to 8-year-old children (n = 32), 9- to 11-year-old children (n = 33), and 18- to 30-year-old young adults (YA; n = 39). Both memory accessibility (cued recall of objects) and precision (precision of object placement) of initially well-learned object–scene pairs were measured. Our results showed that overnight, memory accessibility declined similarly in all age groups; memory precision improved more in younger children (YC) compared to older children (OC) and even declined in YA. After a 2-week period, both memory accessibility and precision became worse. Specifically, while age groups showed similar decline in memory accessibility, precision decline was less in YC than in OC and YA. The accessibility and precision of congruent and incongruent information changed similarly with consolidation in all age groups. Taken together, our results showed that, for initially well-learned information, YC have robust memory consolidation, despite their overall lower mnemonic performance compared to OC and YA, which is potentially crucial for stable and precise knowledge accumulation early on in development.

As a consequence, younger children’s well-documented search inefficiency may turn out to be advantageous and result in better memory for some aspects of the task. In the current experiment, 5- to 10-year-old children (N = 124) played (active condition) or observed an agent play (passive condition) 20-questions games, and were then tested for their memory of several different aspects of the game both immediately after and a week later.

This 3-year longitudinal study examined the developmental patterns of self- and group orientations and their relations with adjustment among Chinese adolescents. The participants included 1,257 students (648 boys, initial Mage = 13.37 years, SD = 0.63 years). Data on self- and group orientations and social and behavioral adjustment were obtained from multiple sources, including self-reports, peer nominations, and teacher ratings. The results showed that self-orientation increased, and group orientation decreased during early adolescence. Moreover, an increase (slope) in self-orientation was positively associated with subsequent assertive behavior, whereas a slower decrease in group orientation was positively associated with subsequent prosocial behavior and peer preference. The initial level (intercept) of self-orientation was positively associated with later externalizing problems, and the initial level of group orientation was negatively associated with later internalizing problems. The intercepts of self- and group orientations were higher for boys than girls. No significant gender differences were found in the slopes of self- and group orientations or in the associations of intercepts and slopes with adjustment outcomes.

The results showed that whereas affinity for solitude was negatively associated with social competence and academic achievement and positively associated with behavioral problems in Grade 4, the associations were weaker or nonsignificant in Grade 6. Moreover, affinity for solitude was positively associated with academic achievement and negatively associated with behavioral problems in Grade 8. Affinity for solitude was negatively associated with psychological adjustment in general, but the associations were weaker in higher grades. The results indicate that the functional meaning of affinity for solitude may differ across developmental periods.

We used data from a Norwegian population-based twin sample including seven birth cohorts (N = 2,879, 56% females). The participants completed self-report questionnaires three times throughout adolescence, with 2 years in between (i.e., 12–18 years old at Wave 1). By using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), we were able to separate stable influences in the measured constructs from the within-person changes at each measurement occasion. In addition, using data from twins allowed us to examine to what degree the associations between life events and loneliness were genetic and/or environmental in nature. The results showed moderate stability of both loneliness and aggregation scores of life events throughout adolescence. The life events were assigned to clusters based on their independence (i.e., events considered dependent or independent on a person’s behavior) and desirability (i.e., positive or negative). The time-stable between-person variance in all three measures, loneliness and person-dependent positive and negative life events, could almost exclusively be accounted for by genetic factors. However, as expected, also shared environmental factors influenced person-independent life events. The associations between time-stable between-person variance in loneliness and life events were small, and nearly exclusively due to shared genetic influences.

Drawing from three samples of young Chinese children (born between 2009 and 2019), we aim at examining how inhibition/shyness predicts cooperative behaviors and prosocial behaviors throughout early childhood. In Study 1 (N = 700, children aged between 36 and 72 months), mother-reported inhibition/shyness was negatively associated with mother-reported cooperative and prosocial behaviors during the preschool years. In Study 2 (N = 251, at 6, 15, 25, and 37 months of children’s ages), mother-reported inhibition/shyness in infancy was negatively associated with mother-reported cooperative behaviors but was not related to observed cooperative behaviors at the early preschool age. Infancy inhibition/shyness was negatively associated with mother-reported and observed prosocial behaviors. In Study 3 (N = 95, at 14, 25, 38, and 60 months of children’s ages), the inhibition/shyness trait, assessed by both observation and maternal report, did not predict any indicators of cooperative behaviors. Early childhood inhibition/shyness, however, still predicted fewer observed and mother-reported prosocial behaviors. On balance, our research supports a negative association between early inhibition/shyness and later prosocial behaviors. The mixed findings concerning cooperative behaviors are interpreted in light of sociopolitical changes in China during the past two decades.

Infants were recruited from the New York City area, and caregivers reported that 25 infants were White, six were Asian, four were Black, and five had multiple races; four were Hispanic or Latino. All infants played in four conditions: two environmental conditions (gross-motor toys, fine-motor toys) crossed with two social conditions (alone, together with a caregiver). Infants moved more in the gross-motor toy conditions than in the fine-motor toy conditions. However, the effect of playing with a caregiver differed by toy condition. In the gross-motor toy conditions, playing with a caregiver did not affect how much infants moved, but in the fine-motor toy conditions, playing with a caregiver further depressed infant locomotion. Infants with more walking experience moved more with gross-motor toys but not with fine-motor toys. Differences in the amount of locomotion between conditions were related to how infants used toys and the interactions between infants and caregivers.

The American Academy of Pediatrics prescribes the age strategy to teach toddlers to safely descend stairs but without much consideration for individual differences in infants’ skills or caregivers’ techniques. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural ways in which caregivers teach infants to descend stairs at home and the extent to which infants abide. Of particular interest was to examine the dynamic nature of caregivers’ teaching and infants’ learning over the session with attention to individual differences. Dyads (N = 59) were videorecorded on Zoom for 10 min interacting on stairs at home in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Italy, and Spain. Infants (n = 30 girls, 29 boys; 13-month-olds ± 1 week) were novice walkers (M = 2.04 months walking experience). Caregivers used a variety of teaching strategies and focused on “backing” and “scooting.” Infants were more likely to heed caregivers’ guidance when caregivers provided hands-on support and verbal encouragement suggesting infants were engaged and responsive to caregivers’ overtures. Infants’ walking experience predicted change in descent strategy over the session. Although infants did not show evidence of learning over the session, consistent caregiver instruction suggested caregivers were persistent, if not effective, teachers. Teaching and learning motor skills in a potentially risky task creates a unique opportunity for interaction, allowing infants and caregivers to learn from one another.

However, most studies have focused on early childhood and relatively few studies have examined associations with changes in maternal education over time. Consequently, it remains unclear if early maternal education is longitudinally related to neurocognitive functions in children, adolescents, and young adults. In addition, the associations between changes in maternal education across development and more broadly defined neurocognitive outcomes remain relatively untested. The current study leveraged a large multicohort sample to examine the longitudinal relations between perinatal maternal education and changes in maternal education during development with children’s, adolescents’, and young adults’ neurocognitive functions (N = 2,688; Mage = 10.32 years; SDage = 4.26; range = 3–20 years). Moreover, we examined the differential effects of perinatal maternal education and changes in maternal education across development on executive function and language performance. Perinatal maternal education was positively associated with children’s later overall neurocognitive function. This longitudinal relation was stronger for language than executive function. In addition, increases in maternal education were related to improved language performance but were not associated with executive functioning performance. Our findings support perinatal maternal education as an important predictor of neurocognitive outcomes later in development. Moreover, our results suggest that examining how maternal education changes across development can provide important insights that can help inform policies and interventions designed to foster neurocognitive development.

However, examinations of the etiology of these behaviors are less prevalent. The current study investigated the driving forces behind parental warmth and discipline, particularly whether they are related more to traits within the parent or reactions to characteristics of the child. To explore this question, three robust factors of child temperament—effortful control, negative affectivity, and surgency/extraversion—and five parent personality traits were examined in association with parent behaviors through differential parenting within 185 four-year-old twin pairs (370 children; 56% girls; 90% White; predominantly middle class). Genetic analyses showed that parents tend to treat both children similarly in terms of parental warmth, but they treat children less similarly in terms of discipline, regardless of child zygosity. Multilevel linear regressions showed that within twin pairs, the child with higher effortful control received less discipline from parents than their cotwin. Analyses also showed that parent agreeableness was significantly related to parent warmth above and beyond other personality traits and child temperament. This study clarified the direction of effects and genetic contributions to parenting behaviors, supporting previous literature that discipline acts in reaction to the child, whereas warmth is more driven by parent personality. This research suggests the importance of focusing on child temperament and parent personality as they relate to parenting behaviors, allowing clinicians and parents to more effectively correct maladaptive parenting behaviors and encourage healthy and adaptive parenting behaviors, thus promoting positive outcomes for children.

Guided by a cascade model framework, the current study used a longitudinal, multimethod, multi-informant design to examine a process model of spillover that tested whether parental executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control) served as a mediator of the prospective associations between IPC and subsequent changes in parenting over a 2-year period. Mothers and fathers were separated into differentiated models and multiple domains of parenting were examined (i.e., authoritarian discipline and scaffolding behavior). Participants included 231 families (both mothers and fathers of preschoolers). Race was reported as White (62%), Black (21%), Mixed (8%), Asian (3%), or Other (6%) and 14% considered their ethnicity to be Hispanic/Latino. Median household income was $65,000. Results indicated that for fathers, IPC indirectly predicted domain-general parenting difficulties (increased authoritarian parenting and decreased scaffolding) via deficits in paternal cognitive flexibility (but not inhibitory control or working memory). In mothers, IPC directly predicted domain-specific parenting difficulties (decreased scaffolding only) that did not operate via maternal executive functions. Notably, these effects occurred over and above the influence of parental socioeconomic status. This study constitutes a first step toward documenting parental executive functioning as a mechanism underlying the spillover of IPC to the parent–child relationship. Family interventions intended to interrupt IPC spillover should emphasize father involvement and consider targeting parental executive functions as change mechanisms.

Yet, little is known about children’s reasoning about peers of varying gender expressions, including age-, gender-, and culture-related influences. We investigated how children aged 4- to 5- and 8- to 9-years-old in Hong Kong and Canada (N = 678) reason about their moral judgments of GC and GN peers. After viewing vignettes describing GC and GN boys and girls, we asked children whether each target peer’s behavior was right or wrong and why they thought so. We coded children’s reasoning using a new coding scheme developed via inductive content analysis. Overall, children’s most commonly used reasoning styles were global standard, personal choice, gender stereotypes, “don’t know,” and others’ welfare. Children used more gender stereotype-related reasoning when they were older and from Hong Kong, appraising the GN boy, or when they perceived the target’s behavior as wrong. In contrast, children reasoned based on personal choice more when they were from Canada or when they perceived the target’s behavior as right. These findings inform how age-, gender-, and culture-related factors are associated with children’s reasoning about the acceptability or appropriateness of varying kinds of childhood gendered behavior. They provide insights regarding children’s appraisals of different gender expressions by illuminating not only how they view GC and GN peers but also, from their own perspectives, why they do so. These insights have implications for strategies aimed at decreasing gender-related biases and increasing children’s acceptance of gender diversity.

In the context of repeated interactions with others, it is not always clear the degree to which in-kind responses reflect responsiveness to partners’ prior behaviors (“reactive” responses), an interest unrelated to the partner (“nonreactive” responses), or any combination of the two. To disentangle these two types of responses, we presented children with sequential, one-shot, and costly interactions between themselves and either egalitarian or selfish peers. Study 1 tested direct, generalized, and normative reciprocal scenarios (N = 144 seven-year-old German children; 50% girls and 50% boys), finding that “nonreactive” responses were dominant for boys and manifested in the form of “selfish” resource distribution. Among girls, “reactive” responses were dominant and manifested in the form of in-kind resource distribution.

While existing research suggests that parental gender beliefs and caregiving behaviors might influence the development of children’s gendered behaviors, little is known about the developmental origins of individual differences in adherence to masculinity norms. The current study aims to address this gap and presents a longitudinal investigation of how parental gender beliefs and maternal sensitivity during infancy contribute to children’s adherence to masculinity norms during middle childhood.

Parental gender beliefs were assessed at 24 months, maternal sensitivity was assessed with mother–child interaction observations at 14 and 24 months, and children’s self-reported adherence to masculinity norms were assessed at age 10 years. Results indicate that while parental gender beliefs had no associations with children’s adherence to masculinity norms, maternal sensitivity predicted children’s adherence to masculinity norms (β = −.18, p = .008) above and beyond parental gender beliefs and parental education level; moreover, there was a significant interaction of sex on the effect of maternal sensitivity on children’s adherence to masculinity (β = −.23, p = .025), and the association was significant only for boys.

However, few studies have used a longitudinal design to examine changes in gender stereotypes across a range of STEM fields. In a large, preregistered study, we examined the developmental trajectories of two gender stereotypes (involving interest and ability) in four STEM fields across three time points within a calendar year, starting in Grades 2–8. The diverse sample included 803 students ages 7–15 years old at the start of the study (50% girls; 8.5% Asian, 6.0% Black, 25.5% Hispanic/Latinx, 43.7% White, and 16.3% other). Multilevel growth modeling was used to examine developmental trajectories in students’ stereotypes for four STEM fields (math, science, computer science, and engineering) while considering both gender and grade level. We found that different STEM disciplines displayed different developmental patterns: Math ability and science interest stereotypes more strongly favored girls over the year among elementary school participants, whereas computer science stereotypes less strongly favored boys over time, and engineering stereotypes (which largely favored boys) were stable across time. The results highlight that the development of stereotypes is not the same for all STEM fields as well as the need to understand the complexity and specificity of developmental change across fields and types of stereotypes.

However, coming out in high school may entail a higher risk of school-based victimization. Due to the greater risk of homophobic bullying, the implications of being out in adolescence and well-being later in adulthood remain unclear. Using data from a national probability survey (Generations Study) of three distinct age cohorts of SM adults (N = 1,474) in the United States, this study (a) examined how being out at school in adolescence affects general well-being in adulthood and (b) SM-specific well-being in adulthood, and (c) examined if these associations differ by cohort. Results from multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that being out in adolescence was not significantly associated with general well-being, but was significantly associated with SM-specific well-being: higher rates of identity centrality and community connectedness, and lower rates of internalized homophobia. There were no cohort differences in the associations between outness in high school, general well-being, and SM well-being. The findings from this national probability sample of SM adults provide novel insight into implications of being out across the life course, including the positive implications of being out at school in adolescence for SM-specific well-being in adulthood.

Children aged 4–8 played 11 rounds of a find-the-sticker game. For each round, an informant looked into two cups and made a claim about which cup held a sticker. Children guessed the sticker’s location and the sticker’s actual location was revealed. Prior to the game, children received information that the informant was either honest or dishonest. In Study 1 (N = 201, 105 female, 96 male), the informant provided inaccurate information on the first five trials and then provided accurate information for the remaining trials (55% overall accuracy). In Study 2 (N = 144, 89 female, 55 male), the informant produced a less predictable pattern of (in)accuracy, but remained 55% accurate overall. The trait information children initially received about the informant’s honesty strongly influenced their epistemic trust when they lacked additional information about the informant’s reliability (the earliest trials). When children’s first-hand experiences with the informant prevented them from making strong predictions about the informant’s future behavior, only children approximately 7 years and older utilized trait information to guide their epistemic trust. These results demonstrate some similarities in children’s causal reasoning about the physical world and their social reasoning. The results also demonstrate developmental patterns in how children weigh different types of social information at different junctures in social interaction.

However, do we think those influences are strong enough to overrule direct evidence of a friend’s unreliability? And do preschoolers expect people to show such biases toward friends and to privilege friendship over reliability? Across three experiments, we explored whether friendship influences the evaluations of trust when others learn labels for novel objects as well as personal opinions. After watching scenes involving a main character, her best friend, and a stranger, preschoolers and adults judged who would be trusted for information from the main character’s perspective (third person) as well as their own (first person). Adults (n = 128, 55 female, recruited online from across the United States) expected the main character to trust information from her friend even if she had been previously inaccurate, while basing their own first-person judgments on accuracy. In contrast, 4- and 5-year-olds (n = 128, 62 female, from the United States) thought that the main character would be like themselves and prioritize accuracy over friendship. Further, preschoolers expected the main character to trust her (inaccurate) friend and (accurate) stranger equally when forming personal opinions. Thus, young children, unlike adults, do not expect others’ epistemic trust to privilege friendship with the speaker over accuracy information.

Although widely studied as a “dark” personality trait in adults, relatively little is known about the developmental correlates of Machiavellian tendencies earlier in life. The present study addressed this knowledge gap by examining associations between Machiavellian behavior and three theoretically relevant social–emotional domains—prosocial emotions, emotion recognition skills, and self-control—in a community sample of 7- and 11-year-old Canadian children (N = 300, 50% female). Of particular interest was the extent to which individual differences in social–emotional capacities were uniquely associated with Machiavellian behavior after controlling for aggression, a relatively well-studied antisocial behavior in childhood. Parents reported on children’s Machiavellian behavior and aggression. Social–emotional correlates were assessed via parent and child reports, behavioral tasks, and physiological assessments. Machiavellian behavior and aggression were similarly associated with lower parent-reported prosocial emotions and self-control. Machiavellian (but not aggressive) behavior was associated with lower child-reported guilt (a prosocial emotion), higher resting skin conductance levels (reflecting a general tendency for higher arousal), and better anger recognition. Semipartial correlational analyses indicated that these patterns of association with Machiavellian behaviors held independent of aggression. These findings indicate that, by middle childhood, Machiavellian behavior constitutes a distinct form of antisocial conduct that is associated with a unique social–emotional risk profile.

However, it is unclear what children infer about each individual’s status from these interactions—do they think dominants and subordinates will maintain their status when interacting with novel partners? In three experiments, we investigate this question. Children (4- to 10-year-olds, N = 365) heard stories about a dominant and subordinate agent and predicted the dominant or subordinate agent’s behavior with a novel agent. In all studies, we found that 7- to 10-year-olds generalized dominance, thinking the dominant would again be dominant or “in charge,” both for social power (e.g., granting permission) in Study 1 and physical dominance (e.g., a fistfight) in Studies 2 and 3. Furthermore, although they believed dominant agents would win dominance contests (fistfights), they did not believe they would win contests unrelated to dominance (math contests). Younger children did not generalize social power (Study 1) but did generalize physical dominance (Studies 2 and 3). However, even for physical dominance, their generalizations were less selective (i.e., they believed the dominant would win fistfights and math contests). Notably, neither age group generalized an agent’s submissiveness in any of the studies—they did not believe a subordinate agent would again be subordinate when paired with a novel partner. We discuss how these results extend past work on children’s developing intuitions about dominance and prompt deeper questions about the inferences children draw from dominance interactions.

However, behavioral inhibition (BI) is a multifaceted characteristic. Some children with BI are fearful when confronted by unfamiliar adults, peers, and objects; others are fearful when separated from their parents. In the present study, we examined specific features of BI that predicted observed friendship formation among preschoolers who are behaviorally inhibited. We also examined whether teacher ratings of classroom behaviors predicted friendship formation. Sixty highly inhibited children (35 female, Mage = 52.57 months) were observed during eight weekly free-play sessions with initially unfamiliar inhibited peers. Free-play periods occurred before weekly intervention sessions for children with BI and their parents. An observational protocol was developed to identify children who made a friend during the eight weekly sessions. Before the first session, different subtypes of BI were assessed by parents; preschool teachers assessed the children’s classroom behaviors with familiar peers. Twenty-six children met the criteria for having made and kept a friend. Probit regression analyses revealed that parent ratings of BI among unfamiliar peers and teacher ratings of children’s social anxiety before the intervention were associated with a decreased probability of making a friend. No evidence was found linking children’s responses to the intervention and friendship formation. Results suggest that extremelyinhibited preschoolers are capable of making friends. Implications for future research and intervention efforts that focus on individual differences of children with BI are discussed.

Furthermore, this study utilized a novel, automatic assessment of romantic attachment security in examining whether romantic attachment assessed at controlled (i.e., self-reported) and automatic (i.e., a rapid word-sorting task) levels of representation differentially serve as spillover mechanisms. Participants included 235 mothers (62% White), fathers (55% White), and a target child between the ages of 2 and 4 (Mage = 2.97; 55% girls) recruited from a moderate-sized metropolitan area in the Northeastern United States. Families were assessed annually across three waves of data collection. Results from autoregressive structural equation model analyses revealed that romantic attachment operated as spillover mechanism for mothers. In particular, hostile interparental conflict was associated with power-assertive discipline through changes in mothers’ automatic romantic attachment security. We also found that hostile interparental conflict was associated with inductive discipline through changes in mothers’ romantic attachment avoidance. Neither controlled nor automatic romantic attachment representations served as spillover mechanisms for fathers. Findings are discussed within family systems and attachment frameworks.

Concurrently, robust preferences for affiliated others may restrict these benefits to in-group peers. We investigated how in-group affiliation (based on minimal group markers) and interpersonal affiliation (based on shared preferences) influence children’s collaborative partner choice. We asked whether children prefer to collaborate with affiliated peers and if highlighting interpersonal affiliation with out-group members reduce in-group bias in partner choice. In Study 1, we assigned children (4–9 years, N = 124, 62 female, two nonbinary) to either a group or interpersonal affiliation condition and gave them a choice of collaborating with either an affiliated (in-group or same preference) or unaffiliated (out-group or different preference) peer. While children preferred affiliated peers in both conditions, interpersonal affiliation had a greater influence than group affiliation on collaborative partner choice among younger participants. With age, the difference between children’s preference for affiliated peers in the interpersonal and group affiliation condition declined until they were similar in middle childhood. In Study 2, we assessed whether shared preferences would override in-group bias when these factors were directly contrasted. Children (4–9 years, N = 62, 33 female) chose between an in-group/different preference or out-group/same preferences peer. Younger children preferred the out-group/same preference peer, a preference that diminished with age to chance levels in middle childhood. These findings suggest that affiliation is an important determinant of collaborative partner choice and that shared preferences can override in-group bias in children’s collaborative partner choice.

The current experiment examines whether two characteristics of self-talk (impact of task difficulty and self-talk’s narrative vs. planning purpose) are also observed in rehearsal. Eighty children, ages 4–7, were tasked with remembering the three-item and six-item lists over a 15-s delay. Children’s spontaneous use of fixed rehearsal (i.e., immediate repetition of a just-presented item) and cumulative rehearsal (i.e., cycling through multiple items at a time) was documented from video recordings. Four-year-olds narrated item presentations using fixed rehearsal. Six- and seven-year-olds proactively planned for recall by engaging cumulative rehearsal. Five-year-olds used both forms of rehearsal, but their frequency of cumulative rehearsal was dependent on list length. Therefore, rehearsal is susceptible to task manipulations that affect other forms of self-talk.

However, to date, the developmental trajectory of these early metacognitive monitoring and control processes and their influence on children’s later memory functioning remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to longitudinally document the development of metacognition between the ages of 2.5 and 4.5 years and to examine the link between these early metacognitive skills and later memory performance. To do so, 69 children initially aged 29–33 months old (NT0 = 69; 32 females; Mage = 32.3 months; SD = 1.6) were tested at three time points (12-month intervals) with a recognition memory paradigm designed to assess both metacognitive monitoring, through retrospective confidence judgment, and metacognitive control, through a cue selection task (i.e., children had the opportunity to ask for a cue to help them change their memory decision). In addition, at the last session, an episodic memory task (story recall) was also administered. Our results revealed an improvement in monitoring and control processes between 2.5 and 4.5 years with above-chance performance from around age 3.5. Mixed-effects modeling also indicated that metacognitive monitoring at ages 2.5 and 4.5, but not—unexpectedly—metacognitive control, was related to children’s memory performance at age 4.5. Overall, our results provide evidence to enhance our understanding of the developmental course of metacognition from toddlerhood to early childhood and suggest that metacognitive processes are involved in memory performance much earlier than had previously been shown.

We tested whether the mean level (“quantity”) and/or the diversity (“variety”) of peers’ ToM influenced children’s own ToM. We also examined whether peer effects on ToM were independent of possible confounding variables (e.g., verbal ability, social isolation) and comparable across children with different initial levels of ToM and social status. Four hundred fifty-four 8–12-year-old children completed assessments of ToM and peer and friendship nominations at baseline and (for ToM only) 1 year later. The variety (but not the quantity) of peers’ ToM predicted the development of children’s ToM over and above control variables. The magnitude of the peer effect was comparable across different levels of children’s ToM and between children indexed as socially isolated and those who were not.

A total of 30 elementary schools (N = 2,870 students) were randomized to a treatment or control condition.

Prior research on the educational experiences of children during the COVID-19 pandemic focused almost exclusively on spring 2020. This article extends this literature past the initial shock of spring 2020, capturing the first full school year (2020–2021) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This registered report study utilized a national sample of 1,666 United States twins in kindergarten through 12th grade from 43 states to provide the current descriptive report of children’s educational experiences during this time, as reported by their parents. Specifically, we reported on school format, parents’ role in education, parent–teacher interactions, schoolwork struggles, technology access, and school services. About half of children attended in-person schooling, with many children switching from online to in-person throughout the school year. Parents saw the pandemic as a risk to their children’s education. During the 2020–2021 school year of the pandemic, parents felt they had a larger role in their children’s education and were less satisfied in their interactions with teachers than what they experienced during the prepandemic part of the 2019–2020 school year. Children experienced more schoolwork struggles than they had in previous years, and this was similar across age groups. For most constructs, results were equivalent across age group, but parents of younger children tended to provide more schoolwork help. Overall, this article highlights the disruptions in their educational environments that children continued to experience through the first full school year (2020–2021) of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While this disambiguation or mutual exclusivity (ME) effect has been robustly shown across development, it is unclear what it involves. Do listeners use their pragmatic and lexical knowledge to exclude the familiar object and thus select the novel one? Or is the effect, at least in early childhood, simply based on an attraction to novelty and a direct mapping of the novel label to a novel object? In a preregistered online study with 2- to 3-year-olds (n = 75) and adults (n = 112), we examined (a) whether relative object novelty alone (without pragmatic or lexical information) could account for participants’ disambiguation and (b) whether participants’ decision processes involved reasoning by exclusion. Participants encountered either a known and an unknown object (classic ME condition) or two unknown objects, one completely novel and one preexposed (novelty condition) as potential referents of a novel label. Reasoning by exclusion was assessed by children’s looking patterns and adults’ explanations. In the classic ME condition, children and adults significantly chose the novel object and both used reasoning by exclusion. In contrast, in the novelty condition, children and adults chose randomly. Across conditions, a retention test revealed that adults remembered their prior selections, while children’s performance was fragile.

Participants were 195 English-speaking children, 7 years old, who were enrolled in French immersion programs. Children were assessed for their degree of “home bilingualism,” reflecting language use patterns at home, and “school bilingualism,” reflecting progress in learning French. None of the children spoke French at home. Participants completed verbal fluency, n-back, and global–local tasks, with conditions within tasks varying in degree of attentional processing required. Type of bilingual experience affected verbal and nonverbal tasks differently. Home bilingualism was positively associated with performance on attentionally demanding conditions of the n-back and global–local tasks, the two nonverbal tasks, whereas school bilingualism was positively associated with performance on English verbal fluency, the linguistic task. In both cases, results were modulated by the degree of bilingual experience. These results underline the importance of specifying the type and degree of bilingual experience and the details of the outcome tasks to understand the impact of bilingualism on children’s development.

Integrating these ideas, we examined whether skill in learning lexical representations is a mechanism that might explain children’s reading development. To do so we conducted a longitudinal study, following 139 children from Grades 3 to 5. In Grade 3, children completed measures of word reading and reading comprehension and again at Grade 5. In Grade 4, children read short stories containing novel words; they were later tested on their memory for the spellings and meanings of these new words, capturing orthographic and semantic learning, respectively. Using multiple-mediation path analysis, we tested whether children’s skill in learning orthographic and semantic dimensions of new words was a mediator of individual differences in each of word reading and reading comprehension. In models controlling for nonverbal ability, working memory, vocabulary, and phonological awareness, we found two clear effects: individual differences in orthographic learning at Grade 4 mediated the gains that children made in word reading between Grades 3 and 5 and individual differences in semantic learning at Grade 4 mediated gains in reading comprehension over the same time period. These findings suggest that children’s ability to learn lexical representations is a mechanism in reading development, with orthographic effects on word reading and semantic effects on reading comprehension. These findings show the power and the specificity of children’s capacity to learn in determining their progress in learning to read.

Theories of the underlying mechanisms differ: Accumulator models emphasize the accumulation of experience with words over time to yield a spurtlike pattern, while cognitive models attribute the spurt to cognitive changes. To test these theories, English–French monolingual and bilingual children with different exposure to each language were studied. Dense, longitudinal data were analyzed from 45 infants aged 16–30 months, whose expressive vocabulary was measured on a total of 617 occasions in English and/or French. Single-language (English and/or French), concept (number of concepts lexicalized across both languages), and word (sum of both languages) vocabulary scores were computed. Infants’ exposure to each language and their exposure balance were measured using a language exposure questionnaire. Logistic curves were fitted to each infant’s data to estimate the timing (midpoint) and steepness (slope) of the vocabulary spurt in single-language, concept, and word vocabularies. Seventy-six percent of infants showed a spurt in at least one vocabulary type, and bilinguals were less likely to show one in their nondominant than their dominant language. For single-language vocabulary, infants with more exposure to a language had earlier spurts. For combined vocabularies (concept and word), monolinguals and unbalanced bilinguals had earlier and steeper spurts than balanced bilinguals. Results better support the predictions of accumulator models than cognitive theories and show that infants follow different vocabulary acquisition trajectories based on their language background.

We investigated sensitivity to advanced tongue root (ATR) harmony in Akan (Kwa, Niger-Congo) in 40 six-month-old multilingual infants (21 girls) in Ghana, West Africa (an understudied population), all learning Akan, Ghanaian English, and most of them several other understudied African languages (e.g., Ga, Ewe). We hypothesized that infants learning both ATR harmony and nonharmony languages would demonstrate sensitivity to ATR harmony. Using the central fixation procedure, infants were presented with disyllabic nonwords that were either harmonic (e.g., puti) or nonharmonic (e.g., petɔ) based on their ATR features. Infants demonstrated sensitivity to ATR harmony with a familiarity preference, listening longer to harmonic syllable sequences than nonharmonic ones. The relative amount of exposure to (an) ATR harmony language(s) did not modulate the preference. These results shed light on our understanding of early multilingualism: they suggest that early sensitivity to VH in multilinguals may be similar to monolingual infants learning other types of VH, irrespective of simultaneous experience with non-VH languages. We conclude with reflections on studying infant language acquisition in multilingual Africa.

In this longitudinal study of 229 U.S. Mexican-origin adolescents (48% female-identifying), youths reported on receipt of social support from family and friends from 10 to 16 years, had their baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) measured at 17 years, reported their prosocial behavior and completed the Mind in the Eyes test to assess cognitive empathy at 17 and 19 years, and reported their prosocial civic behavior (i.e., community activity) at 19 years. Family social support predicted prosocial behavior at 17 years, and friend social support predicted prosocial civic behavior at 19 years. Compared to youths with lower or higher baseline RSA, youths with moderate RSA reported more prosocial civic behavior, had greater cognitive empathy, and tended to report more general prosocial behavior at 19 years. The quadratic association between baseline RSA and cognitive empathy was stronger for youths with greater family social support. These findings are the first to extend the evidence that moderate baseline parasympathetic nervous system activity supports prosocial development into late adolescence and with the U.S. Mexican-origin community, and these findings address calls for more integrative biopsychosocial studies of prosociality.

Using a three-wave longitudinal data set (5 years) of 604 adolescents, cumulative strengths (CS) was calculated, and growth curve analyses showed a similar pattern of findings for both transcultural and cultural cumulative strengths models: Adolescents with higher CS showed higher baseline resilience, life meaning, and discipline.

The present study examined how Chinese American parents’ goals for their children to take on bicultural values and behaviors (i.e., bicultural socialization beliefs) influenced their child’s level of depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood through their parenting behaviors and the level of parent–child alienation. Data came from Waves 2 (adolescence) and 3 (emerging adulthood) of a longitudinal study of 444 Chinese American families. Mothers’ reports of their bicultural socialization beliefs positively predicted adolescents’ reports of mothers’ autonomy-supporting behaviors and interdependence-focused shaming behaviors. In addition, there was a significant and negative indirect effect of mothers’ bicultural socialization beliefs on emerging adult depressive symptoms through adolescents’ reports of mothers’ autonomy-supporting behaviors and emerging adults’ reports of alienation to their parents. In contrast, there was a significant and positive indirect effect from fathers’ reports of their bicultural socialization beliefs to emerging adult depressive symptoms, through emerging adults’ reports of alienation only. Findings contribute to our understanding of bicultural processes in Chinese American families and establish that parents’ beliefs have significant implications for the psychological adjustment of Chinese American youth.

These studies have demonstrated the importance of joint attention in scaffolding the development of attention and the types of dyadic behaviors that support early language learning. Little is known about how often these behaviors occur in toddlers’ everyday lives. We brought wireless head-mounted eye trackers to families’ homes to study the moment-to-moment patterns of toddlers’ and parents’ visual attention and manual activity in daily routines. Our sample consisted of English- and Spanish-speaking families who all reported being middle- or upper middle-class. Toddlers were 2 to 3 years old. Consistent with the findings from previous laboratory studies, we found variability in how frequently toddlers attended to named objects in two everyday activities—Object Play and Mealtime. We then tested whether parent–toddler joint attention in the seconds before a naming utterance increased toddler’s attention on the named object. We found that joint attention accompanied by the attended object being held increased the child’s attention to the labeled object during naming. We posit that in the rich, noisy world of toddlers’ everyday lives, embodied attention plays a critical role in coordinating dyadic behaviors and creating informative naming moments. Our findings highlight the importance of studying toddlers’ natural behavior in the real world.

However, labor-intensive data collection and processing limit the speed at which this understanding can be advanced. Here, we demonstrate an asynchronous workflow for conducting violation-of-expectation (VoE) experiments, which is fully “hands-off” for the experimenter. We first replicate four classic VoE experiments in a synchronous online setting, and show that VoE can generate highly replicable effects through remote testing. We then confirm the accuracy of a state-of-the-art gaze annotation software, iCatcher+ in a new setting. Third, we train parents to control the experiment flow based on the infant’s gaze. Combining all three innovations, we then conduct an asynchronous automated infant-contingent VoE experiment. The hands-off workflow successfully replicates a classic VoE effect: infants look longer at inefficient actions than efficient ones. We compare the resulting effect size and statistical power to the same study run in-lab and synchronously via Zoom. The hands-off workflow significantly reduces the marginal cost and time per participant, enabling larger sample sizes. By enhancing the reproducibility and robustness of findings relying on infant looking, this workflow could help support a cumulative science of infant cognition. Tools to implement the workflow are openly available.

Telicity distinctions in many languages are already partly available to 4–5-year-olds. Here, using exclusively nonlinguistic tasks and a sample of English-speaking children, we ask whether young learners use corresponding temporal notions to characterize event structure—that is, whether children represent events in cognition as bounded temporal entities with a specified endpoint or unbounded temporal units that could in principle extend indefinitely. We find that 4–5-year-old children in our sample compute boundedness during an event categorization task (Experiment 1) and distinguish event boundedness from event completion (Experiment 2). Furthermore, 4–5-year-olds in our sample evaluate interruptions at event endpoints versus midpoints differently—but only for events that are construed as bounded, presumably because in such construals, events truly culminate (Experiment 3). We conclude that young children represent events in terms of foundational and abstract temporal properties. These properties could support the acquisition of linguistic aspectual distinctions and further scaffold the way children conceptualize and process their dynamic experiences.

In Experiment 1, children saw stories about fantasy or real-world characters (e.g., a mermaid or an ordinary woman) and judged whether they would achieve goals using fantastic or realistic methods.

Participants included 199 youth (48.7% female, 65.3% White, 32.2% Black, 2.5% biracial) and their mothers and fathers from a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds. The study utilized a multi-informant, longitudinal design including five waves of data (youths’ mean ages were 9, 10, 11, 17, and 18 across waves). Harsh parenting at Age 9 predicted higher levels of (a) externalizing symptoms at Ages 11, 17, and 18 and (b) internalizing symptoms at Ages 17 and 18. Developmental sensitivity analyses revealed that the magnitude of the more distal association between early harsh parenting and later internalizing and externalizing symptoms was statistically stronger as compared to more proximal associations. Bidirectional analyses revealed that externalizing symptoms at Age 9 predicted harsh parenting at Ages 9, 10, 11, 17, and 18. Whereas links between harsh parenting and internalizing symptoms were consistent with a sleeper effects model, links between harsh parenting and externalizing symptoms provided some support for both enduring and sleeper effects models. Findings inform an understanding of youth developmental sensitivity to harsh parenting and the downstream consequences of harsh parenting.

Across three waves, participants (N = 172, 91 female, 11–16 years across three waves; 439 data points) decided whether to pay money to learn their parents’ or peers’ attitudes about externalizing behaviors. Multivariate growth models revealed that adolescents were consistently willing to pay money over time to learn their parents’ and peers’ attitudes. The value of learning peers’—but not parents’—attitudes predicted changes in personal attitudes during adolescence, and this did not change across age. Moreover, the effect of others’ attitude value on social influence weakened from early to middle adolescence, such that early adolescents who highly valued learning the attitudes of others (i.e., paid more) tended to shift their own attitudes more toward those endorsing positive influence, regardless of the source. In contrast, early adolescents who valued learning others’ attitudes less were less susceptible to positive social influence. Importantly, this effect went away in middle adolescence.

These results underline the need for comprehensive assessments across distinct types of EBs and internalizing problems to better reflect the characteristics that distinguish individual children. Finally, results suggest that children showing early co-occurrent EBs and internalizing symptoms may be an important group to target for in-depth assessment and possibly preventive intervention.

Although these relations have been observed concurrently in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence, few studies leverage longitudinal data to examine long-term prospective relations between cognitive control and anxiety. Using longitudinal data from 149 adolescents (55% female; from predominantly White middle-class families), we assessed temperament in toddlerhood and cognitive control and anxiety at 4, 12, 15, and 18 years of age. At age 4, separate measures of task switching and inhibitory control were obtained via the Dimensional Change Card Sort and Stroop tasks, respectively. At 12, 15, and 18 years of age, planful control was assessed with the AX-Continuous Performance Test, and anxiety symptoms were assessed via self-report. Growth curve models revealed that children with greater inhibitory control at age 4, regardless of BI status, experienced a sharper increase in anxiety symptoms across adolescence. Children with heightened BI during early childhood displayed lower levels of planful control at age 12, but experienced a more rapid improvement in these skills across adolescence. Children with greater task switching ability at age 4 displayed higher levels of planful control at age 12, but experienced a smaller increase in these skills across adolescence. Finally, children’s growth rate for anxiety was unrelated to their growth rate for planful control. These findings reveal that early-life temperament, cognitive control, and anxiety remain interconnected across development, from toddlerhood to at least late adolescence.

Here, we introduce the special issue of Developmental Psychology, “Prenatal Influences Across the Life Course: Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Development,” which draws together a broad collection of 12 empirical studies and one review article. These studies illustrate the diversity in biobehavioral mechanisms and biopsychosocial processes that help explain the long-term impacts of prenatal experiences on human development. Collectively, these studies help to disentangle sources of influence across different life stages (e.g., prenatal from genetic, preconception, and/or postnatal influences) and fill key gaps in the literature, such as the inclusion of minoritized populations currently underrepresented in research, the role of fathers, and protective mechanisms. The research featured in this special issue underscores both the long reach of prenatal influences on child and adolescent development as well as the challenges in observing specific biological mediators given that prenatal risks are currently operationalized as specific or broad cumulative measures. In an effort to organize this complex literature, we propose a guiding framework for how to conceptualize the continued integration of the prenatal environment into the field of developmental psychology. This framework broadens the prevailing dichotomous view of prenatal mechanisms as cumulative or specific to articulate a dimensional approach focused on adaptation. We anticipate that such an approach may uncover meaningful and observable biobehavioral mechanisms of prenatal influence on offspring development in the future.

Little is known about developmental processes in early childhood that may mediate this association. We examined two hypothesized mediational processes linking prenatal risks to ESA emotion regulation (ER) and lability–negativity; parasympathetic functioning at toddler age and chronic risk reflected by continued postnatal maternal negative emotional functioning (i.e., depression, anger/hostility, and emotion dysregulation) and substance exposure. Congruent with differential susceptibility theory, we examined interactions between sensitive parenting and toddler parasympathetic functioning predicting ESA ER. Finally, we explored the role of child sex as a moderator. Mothers (N = 247; 53% male infants; 51% Black, 31% White, 19% Hispanic, and 8% other or mixed race) were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy into one of three groups: PTE (n = 81), PTCE (n = 97), and no substance exposure (n = 69) matched on age and education. Substance exposure was assessed using multiple methods, maternal negative emotional functioning via self-reports, parenting with observations, and child ER using teacher, maternal, and lab assessor reports. Results supported a chronic risk pathway with less support for a parasympathetic pathway. Toddlers who demonstrated respiratory sinus arrhythmia withdrawal to frustration were susceptible to the positive context of sensitive parenting in predicting higher ER. Results emphasize the importance of chronicity of postnatal risks including substance exposure and evaluating the differential impact of positive environments for children with substance exposure.

This study extends this literature by investigating the relation of maternal prenatal social disadvantage (PSD) to neonatal amygdala and hippocampus functional connectivity and whether socioeconomic-related alterations in functional connectivity subsequently predict behavior at age 12 months in a large, socioeconomically diverse sample (N = 261 mother–infant dyads). PSD was assessed across gestation; neonatal magnetic resonance imaging was completed within the first weeks of life; and infant internalizing and externalizing symptoms were evaluated using the Infant–Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment at age 12 months. The results showed that PSD was significantly related to neonatal right amygdala and left hippocampus functional connectivity with prefrontal and motor-related regions. Social disadvantage-related right amygdala and left hippocampus functional connectivity with these regions was subsequently related to infant externalizing and internalizing symptoms at age 12 months. Building off an emerging literature exploring prenatal impacts on neonatal functional connectivity, this study further emphasizes the important role of the maternal environment during gestation on infant brain function and its relationship with externalizing and internalizing behavior in the first years of life. The results suggest that the prenatal socioeconomic environment may be a promising target for interventions aimed at improving infant neurobehavioral outcomes.

However, many PDU-related risk factors, including genetic and rearing environmental risks, can also influence offspring’s problem behaviors, thus confounding PDU, genetic, and rearing environmental influences. This study aimed to (a) identify effects of PDU on school-aged children’s problem behaviors, including both externalizing and internalizing behaviors at Age 7, after controlling genetic and specific rearing environmental (e.g., maternal and paternal hostility at Ages 4.5 and 6) influences and (b) examine interaction effects between PDU and maternal and paternal hostility in predicting children’s problem behaviors at Age 7. We used a parent–offspring adoption design to partition genetic and prenatal effects from postnatal rearing environmental influences. Participants were 561 children adopted at birth (42% female; 56% White, 19% multiracial, 13% Black/African American, 11% Latine, and 1% other), their adoptive parents, and their birth parents. Results indicate that PDU did not show a direct impact on Age 7 problem behaviors before or after controlling genetic risks and adoptive mother’s and father’s hostility. However, we found significant interactions between adoptive father’s hostility and PDU when predicting children’s problem behaviors, such that higher paternal hostility was associated with higher externalizing and internalizing behaviors for children whose birth mothers were non-use or rare use of illicit drugs during pregnancy. The results suggest that different from non- or rare drug-exposed children, higher levels of PDU may override the effects of paternal hostility, but not maternal hostility, on problem behaviors at Age 7.

In this study, path analyses were used to test unique, cascading pathways of prenatal contextual risk and pre- and postnatal maternal psychological distress through social mediators (parenting) and biological mediators (infant stress physiology) on infant temperament and toddler adjustment. The sample is comprised of racially and ethnically diverse first-time mothers (N = 200) living in low-income contexts (< 200% poverty) who were followed from pregnancy to 18–36 months postpartum. In pregnancy, mothers reported contextual risk and psychological distress (anxiety, depression). In the postpartum, mothers reported their psychological distress. At 2–4 months postpartum, observed mother–infant interactions were coded for sensitive responsiveness. Infant cortisol baseline and reactivity to a lab stressor were collected when infants were 4–6 months old. Mothers reported on infant’s temperament (negative affect, effortful control) at 10–12 months and on child adjustment (internalizing, externalizing symptoms) at 18–36 months. Prenatal contextual risk predicted infant cortisol reactivity. Prenatal psychological distress predicted postnatal distress but, when accounting for postnatal distress, did not predict putative mediators or indicators of child adjustment. In contrast, maternal postnatal depression predicted subsequent maternal sensitive responsiveness, which in turn predicted later infant baseline cortisol and cortisol reactivity. Baseline cortisol predicted infant negative affectivity, which predicted toddler internalizing and externalizing symptoms. There was no evidence of mediated effects of prenatal variables on child adjustment outcomes, whereas contextual risk, postnatal psychological distress, and parenting were more salient predictors of child adjustment.

Prenatal risk factors and neonatal epigenetics could help identify preterm children at highest risk for poor cognitive outcomes. We aimed to understand the associations among cumulative prenatal risk, neonatal DNA methylation, and child cognitive ability at age 3 years, including whether DNA methylation mediates the association between prenatal risk and cognitive ability. We studied 379 neonates (54% male) born less than 30 weeks GA who had DNA methylation measured at neonatal intensive care unit discharge along with 3-year follow-up data. Cumulative prenatal risk was calculated from 24 risk factors obtained from maternal report and medical record and epigenome-wide neonatal DNA methylation was assayed from buccal swabs. At 3-year follow-up, child cognitive ability was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (third edition). Cumulative prenatal risk and DNA methylation at two cytosine–phosphate–guanines (CpGs) were uniquely associated with child cognitive ability. Using high-dimensional mediation analysis, we also identified differential methylation of 309 CpGs that mediated the association between cumulative prenatal risk and child cognitive ability. Many of the associated CpGs were located in genes (TNS3, TRAPPC4, MAD1L1, APBB2, DIP2C, TRAPPC9, DRD2) that have previously been associated with prenatal exposures and/or neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our findings suggest a role for both prenatal risk factors and DNA methylation in explaining outcomes for children born preterm and suggest we should further study DNA methylation as a potential mechanism underlying the association between prenatal risk and child neurodevelopment.

The current review outlines evidence that prenatal depression is associated with offspring cardiometabolic risk and health behaviors. We review evidence of these associations in humans and in nonhuman animals at multiple developmental periods, from the prenatal period (maternal preeclampsia, gestational diabetes), neonatal period (preterm birth, small size at birth), infancy (rapid weight gain), childhood and adolescence (high blood pressure, impaired glucose–insulin homeostasis, unfavorable lipid profiles, abdominal obesity), and into adulthood (diabetes, cardiovascular disease). In addition to these cardiometabolic outcomes, we focus on health behaviors associated with cardiometabolic risk, such as child eating behaviors, diet, physical activity, and sleep health. Our review focuses on child behaviors (e.g., emotional eating, preference for highly palatable foods, short sleep duration) and parenting behaviors (e.g., pressuring child to eat, modeling of health behaviors). These changes in health behaviors may be detected before changes to cardiometabolic outcomes, which may allow for early identification of and prevention for children at risk for poor adult cardiometabolic outcomes. We also discuss the methods of the ongoing Care Project, which is a randomized clinical trial to test whether reducing prenatal maternal depression improves offspring’s cardiometabolic health and health behaviors in preschool. The goal of this review and the Care Project are to inform future research, interventions, and policies that support prenatal mental health and offspring cardiometabolic health.

There has been consistency in findings of differential methylation in global DNAm, and the specific genes AHRR, CYP1A1, CNTNAP2, MYO1G, and GFI1 in relation to MSDP. The current study aims to (a) replicate the associations of MSDP and DNAm in prior literature in middle childhood–adolescence (cross-sectionally) using a sibling-comparison design where siblings were discordant for MSDP (n = 328 families; Mage Sibling 1 = 13.02; Sibling 2 = 10.20), adjusting for prenatal and postnatal covariates in order to isolate the MSDP exposure on DNAm. We also (b) cross-sectionally explored the role of DNAm in the most robust MSDP–ADHD associations (i.e., with ADHD-HI) previously found in this sample. We quantified smoking exposure severity for each sibling reflecting time and quantity of MSDP, centered relative to the sibling pair’s average (i.e., within-family centered, indicating child-specific effects attributable MSDP exposure) and controlling for the sibling average MSDP (i.e., between-family component, indicating familial confounding related to MSDP). We found that child-specific MSDP was associated with global DNAm, and CNTNAP2, CYP1A1, and MYO1G methylation after covariate adjustment, corroborating emerging evidence for a potentially causal pathway between MSDP and DNAm. There was some evidence that child-specific CNTNAP2 and MYO1G methylation partially explained associations between MSDP and ADHD-HI symptoms, though only on one measure (of two). Future studies focused on replication of these findings in a longitudinal genetic design could further solidify the associations found in the current study.

In theory, preconception and prenatal stress may affect offspring mental health by influencing child responses to postnatal caregiving. To address this knowledge gap, this study had two aims. First, we examined associations between preconception and prenatal stress with child temperament profiles at age four using multilevel assessment of maternal perceived stress and stress physiology. Second, we tested child temperament profiles as moderators of associations between observed parenting behaviors during a parent–child free-play interaction when children were 4 years old and child behavior problems 1 year later. Latent profile analyses yielded four distinct child temperament profiles: inhibited, exuberant, regulated low reactive, and regulated high reactive. Consistent with hypotheses, preconception, and prenatal stress each independently predicted the likelihood of children having temperament profiles characterized by higher negative emotionality and lower regulation. Specifically, preconception perceived stress and prenatal cortisol predicted likelihood of children having an exuberant temperament, whereas prenatal perceived stress predicted likelihood of children having an inhibited temperament. Contrary to hypotheses, temperament profiles did not moderate predictions of child behavior problems from observed parenting behaviors; however, responsive parenting behaviors inversely predicted child behavior problems independently of child temperament. These findings add to growing evidence regarding effects of preconception factors on child outcomes and underscore a central role for responsive parenting behaviors in predicting more favorable child mental health independent of child temperament.

Prior studies using dichotomous categorization of alcohol use and comorbid substance exposures provide limited knowledge of how prenatal alcohol specifically impacts early human neurodevelopment. In this longitudinal cohort study from Cape Town, South Africa, PAE is measured continuously—characterizing timing, dose, and drinking patterns (i.e., binge drinking). High-density electroencephalography (EEG) during a visual-evoked potential (VEP) task was collected from infants aged 8 to 52 weeks with prenatal exposure exclusively to alcohol and matched on sociodemographic factors to infants with no substance exposure in utero. First trimester alcohol exposure related to altered timing of the P1 VEP component over the first 6 months postnatally, and first trimester binge drinking exposure altered timing of the P1 VEP components such that increased exposure was associated with longer VEP latencies while increasing age was related to shorter VEP latencies (n = 108). These results suggest alcohol exposure in the first trimester may alter visual neurodevelopmental timing in early infancy. Exploratory individual-difference analysis across infants with and without PAE tested the relation between VEP latencies and myelination for a subsample of infants with usable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1w and T2w scans collected at the same time point as EEG (n = 47). Decreased MRI T1w/T2w ratios (an indicator of myelin) in the primary visual cortex (n = 47) were linked to longer P1 VEP latencies. Results from these two sets of analyses suggest that prenatal alcohol and postnatal myelination may both separately impact VEP latency over infancy.

The present study used a multimethod approach to simultaneously examine the mediating role of the developmental trajectories of observed parenting quality (support, stimulation, and structure) and children’s functional brain networks (small-worldness) from infancy into the preschool period in a sample of 233 children and their biological mothers. The results revealed a potential sleeper effect: Prenatal exposure to risk was negatively related to child self-regulation during the preschool period, but not during infancy. Parenting quality remained relatively stable over time, whereas small-worldness showed an increase during infancy, followed by a decrease into the preschool age period. These developmental changes did not mediate the relation between prenatal risk and child self-regulation. Prenatal exposure to risk was related to lower levels of maternal support during infancy, but did not affect the development of parenting quality over time. Prenatal risk was also not related to the growth rate of small-worldness in young children. However, the developmental changes in small-worldness predicted individual differences in child self-regulation. These findings suggest that children generally have the potential to benefit from positive postnatal parenting environments, regardless of the levels of prenatal risk. A potential target for intervention efforts based on the current findings might be related to postnatal experiences that impact the development of functional brain networks, which in turn could affect the development of child self-regulation.

However, because prematurity is related to obstetrical and neonatal complications, it is unclear what may drive the effect. Effortful control also has a strong heritable component; therefore, environmental factors during pregnancy and the neonatal period may interact with genetic factors to predict effortful control development. In this study, we aimed to dissect the influences of genetics, prematurity, and neonatal and obstetrical complications on the development of effortful control from 12 months to 10 years using a twin cohort. This study used data from the Arizona Twin Project, an ongoing longitudinal study of approximately 350 pairs of twins. Twins were primarily Hispanic/Latinx (23.8%–27.1%) and non-Hispanic/Latinx White (53.2%–57.8%), and families ranged in socioeconomic status with around one third falling below or near the poverty line. Of the twins, 62.6% were born prematurely. Effortful control was assessed via parent report at six waves. There was not a significant relationship between gestational age and effortful control regardless of whether obstetrical and neonatal complications were controlled for. Biometric twin modeling revealed that the attentional focusing subdomain of effortful control was highly heritable. Gestational age did not moderate genetic and environmental estimates. Our findings help inform the risk assessment of prematurity and provide evidence for the differing etiology of each subdomain of effortful control and the strong role of genetics in effortful control development.

The current study investigated associations between emotional and instrumental support during pregnancy and resilience to stress during pregnancy, including perceived resilience (belief in ability to “bounce back” from adversity) and physiological resilience (ability to physiologically recover quickly after an acute stressor). We further tested whether support and resilience during pregnancy predicted offspring internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Participants included 130 pregnant women (ages 26–28 years; 58% Black, 27% White, 15% Multiracial; 28% receiving public assistance) from a population-based longitudinal study. During pregnancy, participants reported on emotional and instrumental support, current life stressors, and perceived resilience to stress. In addition, heart rate variability was recorded continuously before, during, and after a controlled stress test to measure physiological recovery from stressors. When offspring were 2–3 years of age, mothers reported on children’s internalizing and externalizing problems. Results from moderated mediation analyses indicated that emotional, but not instrumental, support was associated with perceived resilience during pregnancy, which predicted lower internalizing and externalizing problems in offspring. Emotional support also predicted greater physiological recovery during pregnancy, but only for individuals reporting multiple life stressors. Findings suggest that emotional support may influence psychological and physiological responses to stress during pregnancy, with implications for offspring emotional and behavioral health. Clinical implications of these results and directions for future research are discussed.

Changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) may represent a potential mechanism; however, findings are heterogeneous and limited to early infancy. This preregistered study examined whether mode of birth (vaginal birth compared with elective or emergency cesarean section) affects DNAm at birth, in childhood, and adolescence and whether these effects are modified by the postnatal care environment, specifically by breastfeeding and mother–infant bonding. Using data from 876 mother–infant dyads from the U.K. Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we examined differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides and regions associated with mode of birth. DNAm was quantified using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip in cord blood (at birth) and in peripheral blood (at 7 and 15–17 years). Analyses controlled for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, child sex, gestational week at birth, and batch effects. We also examined interactions of mode of birth with breastfeeding practices and mother–infant bonding. In cord blood, two cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (cg05230316; cg13230077) were linked to mode of birth (pFDR pFDR > .050), and breastfeeding and mother–infant bonding were not moderators (p > .050). Overall, findings suggest mode of birth may have a small effect on cord blood DNAm, but these effects may not persist into later developmental stages. Other postnatal influences should be considered, and further investigation is needed to address study limitations.

The present study tests whether older children (6–7-year-olds) are more skeptical than younger children (4–5-year-olds) about surprising claims that lack supporting evidence because they expect informants to provide evidence for them. To test this hypothesis, we presented 140 4–7-year-old children (47–96 months, 46.4% girls, 53.6% boys, 86.4% with at least one parent who completed a BA degree, 50% parents with income above median) with a series of vignettes. In each vignette, the protagonist wanted to accomplish a task and needed to select the most appropriate object for that task. Before deciding which object to use, the protagonist heard a surprising claim about one of the object’s properties, presented with or without supporting evidence. For example, in the supporting explanation condition, the informant stated that the smallest object was the heaviest and that they knew because they had lifted the objects. Children were then asked whether the protagonist knew which object to use and why. Contrary to expectation, children across all ages typically indicated that the protagonist had sufficient knowledge, regardless of whether an informant provided supporting evidence or not. However, with increasing age, children became more skeptical of both supported and unsupported surprising claims and increasingly stated that the protagonist should not select the object suggested by the informant. Finally, when asked to justify this judgment, older children were more likely than younger to express skepticism toward the claims, especially when presented without supporting evidence.

For example, walking through a solid wall seems more impossible if it is made of stone rather than wood. Across four experiments, we investigated how children and adults assess the relative impossibility of events, contrasting two kinds of information they may use: perceptual information and causal knowledge. In each experiment, participants were told about a wizard who could magically transform target objects into other things. Participants then assessed which of the two transformation spells would be easier or harder, a spell transforming a target object into a perceptual match (i.e., a similar-looking thing) or one transforming it into a causal match (e.g., an item made of similar materials). In Experiments 1–3, children aged 4–7 mainly thought that transformations into the perceptual match would be easier, though this tendency varied with age. Adults were overall split when choosing which spell would be easier. In Experiment 1, this was because of variations in their judgments across different pairs of spells; in Experiments 2 and 4, the split resulted because different subsets of adults preferred either the perceptual or causal match. Overall, these findings show that children, and many adults, use perceptual reasoning to assess relative impossibility.

To disentangle the respective influence of accumulated factual knowledge and executive functions (inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) on (a) the development of categorization abilities in the food domain and (b) differences in this development by child characteristics (i.e., food neophobia), we conducted two experiments. The first experiment assessed 4−6-year-old children’s (n = 122) ability to taxonomically categorize food at the superordinate level of categorization. The second experiment tested 3−6-year-old children’s (n = 100) ability to cross-categorize the same food according to two different relationships alternatively (i.e., taxonomic and thematic). Results indicate that accumulated factual knowledge and executive functions mediated both the effect of age and the effect of food neophobia on categorization performance. Notably, the specific executive functions involved may vary depending on the categorization abilities tested, whereas world knowledge was always a prerequisite. Overall, this research highlights the complex interplay between accumulated factual knowledge, executive functions, and child characteristics in shaping the development of categorization abilities.

Maternal and child behaviors were rated in 30-s epochs during play when children were 32 months old (Time 1; N = 128; 66 girls). Children were rated on their responsiveness and assertiveness toward an unfamiliar peer in the early preschool years (Time 2) and toward a friend in the late preschool years (Time 3). Residual dynamic structural equation models showed that stronger positive contemporaneous coupling of maternal sensitivity and children’s responsiveness in a given 30-s epoch of the play session predicted greater observed responsiveness toward a friend in the late preschool years, after controlling for mean levels of maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness. On the other hand, positive contemporaneous coupling of maternal sensitivity and child assertiveness predicted children’s higher levels of observed assertiveness toward an unfamiliar peer in the early preschool years, after controlling for mean levels of maternal sensitivity and child assertiveness. Results suggest that the dynamic coupling of specific positive behaviors during mother–child interaction may provide children with social scripts to draw on in diverse peer contexts.

Participants were 85 three-year-old children (54% female) and their mothers oversampled for lower income, higher stressful life events, and higher child maltreatment risk. Child behavioral regulation, assessed as compliance and noncompliance, and maternal supportive parenting were observed during a challenging dyadic puzzle task. Results showed that child RSA exhibited quadratic change across the task on average, characterized by an expected initial decrease and subsequent recovery. Child behavioral regulation and its interaction with maternal supportive parenting were associated with interindividual differences in child RSA reactivity trajectories after controlling for child resting RSA. Children with higher compliance or lower noncompliance showed RSA decreases in response to task stressors but exhibited subsequent RSA recovery only when mothers displayed higher supportive parenting. Children with lower compliance or higher noncompliance displayed negligible RSA changes overall across the task, suggesting blunted or compromised RSA reactivity, regardless of supportive parenting levels. These findings demonstrate novel evidence that preschoolers’ better behavioral regulation is related to their more adaptive physiological reactivity to stressors and that supportive parenting is needed to facilitate physiological recovery even in relatively better-regulated preschoolers.

However, developmental research to date has allocated comparatively little focus to the dynamic processes of how social interactions emerge across these levels of analysis. Second-person neuroscience and dynamic systems approach together to offer an integrative framework for addressing these questions. This study quantified respiratory sinus arrhythmia and social behavior (∼360 observations per system) from 44 mothers and typically developing 9-month-old infants during a novel modified “still-face” (text message perturbation) task. Stochastic autoregression models indicate that the infant parasympathetic nervous system is coupled within and between people second by second and is sensitive to social context. Intraindividual, we found positive coupling between infants’ parasympathetic nervous system activity and their social behavior in the subsequent second, but only during the moments and periods of active caregiver engagement. Between people, we found a bidirectional coregulatory feedback loop: Mothers’ parasympathetic activity positively predicted that of their infant in the subsequent second, a form of synchrony that decreased during the text message perturbation and did not fully recover. Conversely, infant parasympathetic activity negatively predicted that of their mother at the subsequent second, a form of synchrony that was invariant over social context. Findings reveal unidirectional parasympathetic coupling within infants and a complementary allostatic feedback loop between mother and infant parasympathetic systems. They offer novel evidence of a dynamic, socially embedded parasympathetic system at previously undocumented timescales, contributing to both basic science and potential clinical targets to better support adaptive, multisystem social development.

Participants completed a longitudinal study over three waves within one academic year. Results indicated that within-person increases in ASMC preceded within-person increases in appearance-contingent self-worth and were bidirectionally associated with worse appearance esteem, with no differences in these associations by gender. Among girls only, self-objectification was associated with subsequent within-person increases in ASMC, but not vice versa. Findings indicate that online appearance preoccupation may influence and be reinforced by general body image concerns.

Results demonstrated that perfectionists expressed feeling less connected online than nonperfectionists, likely driven by heightened levels of interpersonal sensitivity. However, a subgroup of perfectionists sought out meaningful online relationships, often in response to a fear or experience of rejection by in-person peers. The results highlight the role of interpersonal sensitivity in fueling feelings of disconnection among adolescent perfectionists in both online and in-person settings, as well as the importance of self-monitoring in the social experiences of perfectionistic youth.

Through interviews, participants recalled life experiences that they considered crucial to their understanding of their own ERI in childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood. Using longitudinal qualitative analysis, three distinct pathways of ERI development were identified: consolidating (no change to the understanding they developed earlier in life), cumulative (successive additions or expansions to their current understanding of their own ERI), and transformative (their ERI trajectory is qualitatively altered by a turning point event). Results revealed that the development of ERI components is influenced by the interplay of contextual, individual, and developmental factors, along with the ongoing meaning-making of identity-relevant experiences. Findings lend empirical support for adopting a lifespan approach to ERI development, demonstrating ERI development as a dynamically interactive and continuous process.

Guided by the social sharing of emotions framework and the cultural theory on self-construal, this study investigated the developmental course of freshmen’s emotional disclosure with parents during the first semester and the mediating role of independence-orientation in two Asian contexts—Beijing (China) and Singapore. Using experience sampling method (online diary), 205 Chinese freshmen (Mage = 19.43) and 291 Singapore freshmen (Mage = 19.44) reported on four facets of emotional disclosure with parents (frequency, intimacy, negativity, and positivity) across four timepoints and their independence–interdependence orientation (Time 1). Latent growth curve modeling comparing the two Asian samples revealed that frequency increased for Chinese students and decreased for Singapore students. Intimacy indicated upward trajectories for both Asian samples, whereas negativity and positivity showed downward trajectories but were less pronounced for Chinese students. Mediated latent growth curve modeling revealed that the cultures predicted independence-orientation, which in turn negatively predicted increase in frequency for the Singapore sample and positively predicted decrease for the Chinese sample. Independence-orientation negatively predicted increase in intimacy, positively predicted decline in negativity, and negatively predicted decline in positivity. In sum, we found complex and differentiated trajectories for the four facets of emotional disclosure in two Asian samples and the mediating role of independence-orientation in explaining cultural differences in the trajectories, which have implications for understanding emotional disclosure to parents during the developmental phase of the college transition in Asian contexts.

This research and studies with older infants indicate that both the formation and the expansion of schemata occur through moderate discrepancies, a concept that Jerome Kagan promoted conceptually and through his research. Discrepancy, as distinct from novelty, is insufficiently acknowledged in the literature on schema theory. The schema is both cognitive and affective and develops in unison in a curvilinear pattern with a gradual onset and exponential expansion. Optimal attentiveness and positive affect occur at the peak of formation and to moderate discrepancies. Redundancy beyond the optimal level produces decreasing interest and positive affect and increasing negative affect resulting in boredom and avoidance. These characteristics of schema development are difficult to study with older children and adults. Rumelhart (1980) regarded the schema as the “building block of cognition” and Kagan (2002) called its expansion through moderate discrepancies an “engine of change” implying widespread application for cognition and behavior throughout life. Kagan urged the search for structure (form) as opposed to function in cognition, and the curvilinear pattern of schema development and its characteristics, it is argued, is the structure he sought. Implications and select applications of schema development and expansion are presented.

Jerome Kagan observed that the same behavior can occur for different reasons, and differing behaviors can occur for the same reason. To help account for persistence, desistence, and transformation of behavior across development, Kagan introduced various types of continuity and discontinuity of forms and functions of behavior. This framework provides opportunities for identifying explanatory mechanisms in behavior development. However, misconceptions remain in applying the concepts that Kagan introduced. Much of the literature assumes developmental continuity in constructs without examining whether assumptions are supported, leading to faulty developmental inferences. For instance, the use of the same measure across time to assess development assumes that the behavior occurs for the same reason across time (homotypic continuity). In addition, just because one behavior predicts a different behavior at a later time does not necessarily indicate that age-differing behaviors occur for the same reason (heterotypic continuity). This review aims to advance conceptualizations of continuity and discontinuity from a contemporary perspective with aims to improve mechanistic understanding of behavior development across the lifespan. To better align behaviors, functions, and mechanisms, research should (a) examine (dis)continuity of individual behaviors rather than merely syndromes, (b) identify the function(s) of the given behavior(s), and (c) identify the cognitive and biological processes that underlie the behavior–function pairs. Incorporating examples from research on development of humans and nonhuman animals, I discuss challenges from work that has followed Kagan’s ideas and ways to advance understanding of continuity and discontinuity across development.

His main reasons were the minimal overlap between (self-)reported and observed phenotypes, the ambiguity of items, and systematic socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in responding. We wondered whether genetic differences would also influence response bias in cases of ambiguous or even absurd items triggering an acquiescence bias to agree with even impossible question content. We examined the genetic predisposition for the acquiescence response bias in 257 families with twins. Both parents and twins completed a modified Wildman Symptoms Questionnaire and provided salivary DNA samples. From published genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we derived polygenic score (PGS) algorithms for indicators of SES (educational attainment [EA] and income) and for general intelligence (IQ), which were applied to the GWAS results of our participants’ DNA. The twins (N = 514 children, 55% monozygotic pairs) were on average 7.92 years old (SD = 0.66), and 51.6% were female. The primary parents were on average 40.48 years old (SD = 4.66), and 91% were female. In 90% of the families, both parents were born in the Netherlands and 91% were from a middle or higher socioeconomic background. Higher PGSs for EA and income but not for IQ predicted less acquiescence response bias in parents and children. In addition to Kagan’s reasons for his concerns about questionnaires, we found a genetic predisposition to response bias triggered by the ambiguous form of questions and answers.

To expand the limited options for assessing TS, this article tested the psychometric properties of a new Q-set measure (i.e., TS Q-scale) derived from the California Child Q-Set (CCQ-Set) and completed by experimenters. Participants in Study 1 consisted of 243 mothers, their partners, and their preschool children (Mage = 4.60 years; 56% girls; 54% Black or multiracial; 16% Latinx). For Study 2, participants included 201 mothers and their young children (Mage = 2.25 years; 44% girls; 63% Black or multiracial; 11% Latinx). Both longitudinal studies utilized multimethod, multiinformant measurement batteries. The TS Q-scale evidenced satisfactory internal consistencies across both studies. Support for the convergent and discriminant validity in Study 1 was evident in its large, unique, and significantly stronger association with a standard, more extensive, observational assessment of TS when compared with conventional dimensions of temperament. In each study, the TS Q-scale significantly moderated the association between family functioning and latent change analyses of children’s functioning for most of the forms of child adjustment. Supporting its predictive validity as a differential susceptibility attribute, children with higher scores on the TS Q-scale exhibited substantially better functioning than their peers in supportive socialization contexts and considerably worse functioning in harsh rearing conditions.

BI is a moderately stable trait, with biological and genetic underpinnings. Kagan’s methodology for assessing BI is widely used in humans. Although this paradigm could be readily translated for use in nonhuman primates, thereby increasing generalizability from nonhuman primates to humans and fortifying evidence that BI is evolutionarily conserved, researchers have not done so. To address this, this study utilized a modified version of Kagan’s paradigm to assess behaviors and biological markers of BI in nonhuman primates. Over the first 5 weeks of life, nursery-reared rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; N = 12) were rated using the standardized Infant Behavior Assessment Scale for nonhuman primates on measures related to BI (consolability, irritability, struggle, and predominant state). Three months later, behavioral assessments were made in relation to a novel playroom, an unfamiliar peer, and a variety of attention-grabbing, unfamiliar stimuli, followed by the introduction of a human stranger. Behaviors from Kagan’s studies of BI in toddlers (freezing, exploration, and latency to approach) and physiological measures related to BI (heart rate) were assessed. Random effects models showed that subjects rated high in temperamental BI spent less time exploring the environment and socializing with peers and more time freezing (an indication of anxiety in rhesus monkeys). These findings suggest that Kagan’s paradigm is readily adapted for use in nonhuman primates and support the utility of rhesus monkeys as translational models for assessing the causes and consequences of human BI.

The analysis is based on a prospective longitudinal cohort study that collected data from the first trimester and conducted observational assessments of temperament at approximately 12 months of age (n = 281 infants). MIA was assessed from immune biomarkers measured in maternal blood at each trimester; infant temperament was assessed using the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery assessment at 12 months; covariates included family and sociodemographic factors. Patterns of inflammatory markers across gestation reliably predicted observed temperament: elevated prenatal MIA was associated with high fear reactivity to novel stimuli. The findings provide novel evidence of prenatal origins of fear reactivity and suggest developmental mechanisms that may underlie early emerging individual differences in child temperament.

In this study, we investigated whether differences in neonatal brain responses to infrequent auditory stimuli relate to children’s BI at 1 year of age. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we collected blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data from N = 45 full-term, sleeping neonates during an adapted auditory oddball paradigm and measured BI from n = 27 of these children 1 year later using an observational assessment. Whole-brain analyses corrected for multiple comparisons identified 46 neonatal brain regions producing novelty-evoked BOLD responses associated with children’s BI scores at 1 year of age. More than half of these regions (n = 24, 52%) were in prefrontal cortex, falling primarily within regions of the default mode or frontoparietal networks or in ventromedial/orbitofrontal regions without network assignments. Hierarchical clustering of the regions based on their patterns of association with BI resulted in two groups with distinct anatomical, network, and response-timing profiles. The first group, located primarily in subcortical and temporal regions, tended to produce larger early oddball responses among infants with lower subsequent BI. The second group, located primarily in prefrontal cortex, produced larger early oddball responses among infants with higher subsequent BI.

First, we examined profiles of reactivity in 4-month-old infants using the traditional theory-driven analytic approach laid out by Jerome Kagan and colleagues, and derived groups characterized by extreme patterns of negative reactivity and positive reactivity. We then used a theory-neutral, data-driven approach to create latent profiles of reactivity from the same infants. Despite differences in sample characteristics and recruitment strategy, we noted similar reactivity groups relative to prior cohorts. The current data-driven approach found four profiles: high positive, high negative, high motor, and low reactive. Follow-up analyses found differential predictions of internalizing, externalizing, dysregulation, and competence trajectories across 12, 18, and 24 months of life based on 4-month reactivity profiles. Findings are discussed in light of the initial formulation of early reactivity by Kagan and the four decades of research that has followed to refine, bolster, and expand on this approach to child-centered individual differences.

Although these topics have yielded an abundance of research, fewer studies have employed observational data during middle childhood, when unique environmental challenges could influence temperament development. To address this gap, Israeli twin children were observed at Age 6.5 (N = 1,083, 564 families; 50.6% females) and again at Age 8–9 (N = 768, 388 families; 52.0% females; 611 children from 322 families had data from both ages). Temperament was assessed globally by trained coders and, at Age 8–9, also by the experimenter who interacted with the child. We examined whether Rothbart et al.’s (2000) three-factor model, according to which temperament includes the domains negative affect, positive affect/surgency, and effortful control, emerges from the data. In addition, we considered a bifactor model, where a fourth global factor accounts for all behaviors’ commonality. Across the two ages and rating methods, confirmatory factor analyses supported the bifactor model. The global factor’s loadings suggested that it reflects children’s expressiveness. Adding this factor changed the associations between the other factors and enabled differentiation between surgency and positive affect. This suggests that in observational settings that capture temperament impressions holistically, children’s expressiveness affects other traits’ behavioral displays. Twin models revealed genetic influences for most traits. Importantly, twin models revealed shared-environmental influences for negative affect and expressiveness, which modestly contributed to temperament consistency across ages. These findings shed light on temperament traits’ interrelatedness and stress the importance of the shared environment to temperament development during middle childhood.

It has typically been conceptualized as effortful control (EC) or executive function (EF), drawing respectively on research traditions in temperament and cognitive development. These aspects of SR are theorized to emerge from an intertwined developmental process, but the nature of their relation throughout elementary school has not been established. In particular, it is not known whether ratings given by teachers based on behavioral observations align with those directly assessed via novel performance tasks. This article addresses this gap in the knowledge by examining the codevelopment of EC and EF with regard to intraindividual trajectories of change. Drawing on a national sample (N = 8,742) from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort of 2010–2011, two longitudinal modeling approaches (parallel-process latent growth curves with structured residuals, Curran et al., 2014; multidimensional growth mixture models, Wickrama et al., 2021) were applied to examine children’s SR between second and fifth grade. Overall, results do not reveal a systematic codevelopmental relation between EC and EF when accounting for intraindividual processes. Findings are discussed with regard to developmental theory and application.

How children behave or respond toward diverse social contexts can influence the relation between BI and social adjustment. This study investigated the effect of children’s affiliative and antagonistic behavior in cooperative and competitive contexts on the relation between early BI and social adjustment using a longitudinal design. Children’s BI (at age 2) was assessed via laboratory observations. Affiliative and antagonistic behaviors (at age 4) were coded during a dyadic truck game in the cooperative and competitive contexts. Children’s emotional symptoms and peer problems (at age 4) were assessed using parental reports. These results suggest that high affiliative behavior in the cooperative context was linked to a reduced level of peer problems in inhibited children. Interestingly, highly antagonistic behavior in the competitive context was linked to a reduced level of emotional symptoms in inhibited children. These findings extend our understanding of the role social behavior plays in the social adjustment of behaviorally inhibited children by highlighting the contribution of socially appropriate behaviors in social contexts.

Early socioemotional communication in dyadic interactions may form a foundation for triadic referential communication and gesture production, yet the role of temperament in moderating their association has not been examined. We investigated whether early socioemotional communication behaviors, and infant temperamental reactivity, were associated with later pointing production. Participants were 51 infants (45% girls) and both their parents (86.5% Dutch). Early infant socioemotional communication (production of smile, vocalizations, and gaze) was observed during separate home-based face-to-face interactions with mothers, fathers, and strangers at 4 and 8 months. At both ages, mothers and fathers reported on infant temperamental surgency and negative affectivity, and overall means were calculated. Referential communication (declarative pointing) was measured during structured lab-based observations at 12 and 15 months. Socioemotional and referential communication behaviors were microanalytically coded second by second. Poisson multilevel regression analyses indicated interaction effects between temperament and smile, vocalizations, and gazes to the adult’s face with each partner in predicting pointing. High levels of infant temperamental surgency tended to enhance positive associations between early socioemotional communication behaviors with mothers and fathers and pointing. By contrast, high levels of negative affectivity tended to dampen associations between early communication behaviors with strangers and pointing. Results highlight the importance of infant socioemotional communication with diverse partners and the moderating role of temperamental reactivity in predicting referential communication.

Moreover, some studies have demonstrated an above-chance level chance of concordance between the quality of child–mother and child–father attachment relationships, and child temperament has been offered as a plausible explanation for such concordance. To assess whether temperament plays a role in the development of different attachment network configurations, in this preregistered individual participant data meta-analysis we tested the degree to which the temperament dimension of negative emotionality predicts the number of secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-resistant, and disorganized attachment relationships a child has with mother and father. Data included in the linear mixed effects analyses were collected from seven studies sampling 872 children (49% female; 83% White). Negative emotionality significantly predicted the number of secure (d = −0.12) and insecure-resistant (d = 0.11), but not insecure-avoidant (d = 0.04) or disorganized (d = 0.08) attachment relationships. Nonpreregistered exploratory analyses indicated higher negative emotionality in children with insecure-resistant attachment relationships with both parents compared to those with one or none (d = 0.19), suggesting that temperament plays a small yet significant role in child–mother/child–father insecure-resistant attachment relationships concordance. Taken together, results from this study prompt a more in-depth examination of the mechanism underlying the small yet significantly higher chance that children with increased negative emotionality have for developing multiple insecure-resistant attachment relationships.

Infant “negative reactive” tendencies have been robustly linked to resting brain activity profiles that confer risk for maladaptive socioemotional outcomes. The present study examines whether and how caregiver behavior in early infancy may interact with infant negative reactivity to alter the extent to which such tendencies predict risk-related brain activity profiles. In the present study, 51 mothers (all White; age M = 32 years, SD = 3; 70.8% monthly household income > 3,400 U.S. dollars) and their infants (39.2% female at birth) participated. We measured infant negative reactivity and maternal contingent responsiveness to infant’s gaze during mother–infant interactions at age 4 months. At 10–11 months, we assessed infants’ resting electroencephalographic (EEG) 6–9 Hz frontal asymmetry (a marker of risk for maladaptive regulatory behaviors and withdrawal), infant fearful withdrawal, and infant empathic behavior. We found that maternal contingent responsiveness to 4-month-old infant’s gaze in naturalistic interactions moderated the relation between 4-month infant negative reactivity and 11-month resting EEG asymmetry. Results suggest that maternal contingent responsiveness alters the extent to which early reactive tendencies end up “embedded” in infant brain activity profiles. Exploratory analyses revealed that the interaction between maternal contingent responsiveness and infant reactivity predicting infant resting EEG asymmetry, in turn predicted infants’ fearful withdrawal and empathic behaviors also assessed at 10–11 months. Findings demonstrate the critical buffering role of maternal contingent responsive behaviors in reducing potential maladaptive neural and socioemotional outcomes.

One proposed physiological correlate of shyness has been the change in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) from baseline to a stressor. However, past research linking shyness and RSA change has been mixed, which may be, in part, due to a failure to carefully consider the context under which RSA change is measured and the directionality of relations. Using a longitudinal design and cross-lagged analysis (N = 103, 52 girls), we examined parent-reported shyness and RSA change during a stranger approach task (social stressor) and a locked box task (nonsocial stressor) at ages 3 (Mage at Time 1 = 3.50 years, SDage = 0.19 years) and 4 (Mage at Time 2 = 4.76 years, SDage = 0.38). Cardiac vagal withdrawal during the stranger approach task, but not during the frustration task, at age 3 positively predicted shyness at age 4. Shyness at age 3 did not predict cardiac vagal change in either context at age 4. We also found that changes in RSA measured during the frustration task were stable across time, but changes in RSA measured during the stranger approach task were not stable across time, suggesting a developmental change in physiological regulatory systems to social threat. These results suggest that, although biology may come first in shaping children’s behavior, this relation depends critically on the context and the incentives in the child’s environment.

Even though temperament is suggested to have a biological basis, the physiological indicators of inhibitory control remain unclear amid mixed empirical results. In this study, we leveraged a multicohort longitudinal design to examine resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) as a physiological correlate of inhibitory control across the early and middle childhood years. Data were collected annually across four time points from cohorts of 4- (n = 150, Mage = 4.53; SD = 0.30; 49.7% female) and 8- (n = 150; Mage = 8.53; SD = 0.29; 49.7% female) year-old children and their caregivers. There were weak, albeit significant, associations between resting RSA and caregiver-reported inhibitory control in middle childhood but not in early childhood. A stronger association was found for older children when latent trait assessments of RSA and inhibitory control were derived from commonalities across the four annual assessments. We conclude that using repeated measures to extract latent trait scores increases power to detect potential physiological indicators of temperament.

Despite evidence, temperament research remains focused on a few prominent dimensions of temperament, without adequately addressing covariance among dimensions and temperament types. Using longitudinal twin data, we took a person-centered statistical approach to identify temperament types and examined continuity and change across five developmental periods (Ninfancy = 602; Ntoddlerhood = 522; Nearly childhood = 390; Nlate childhood = 718; Nearly adolescence = 700). We then examined the genetic and environmental etiology of temperament types. Twins were boys and girls (51–53% female), primarily Hispanic/Latinx (23–30%) and non-Hispanic/Latinx White (56–63%), and from socioeconomically diverse families (28–38% near-or-below the poverty line). Using latent profile analysis, we identified three temperament types at each age characterized by negative reactivity and dysregulation, positive reactivity and strong self-regulation, and moderate reactivity and regulation. Latent transition analyses revealed considerable continuity in membership type for “negative dysregulated” beginning in infancy, log odds = 1.58 (SE = .65) to 3.16 (SE = .77), p SE = .56) to 2.25 (SE = .47), p < .05. Twin analyses revealed moderate heritability and a consistent role of the shared environment on positive well-regulated, with negative dysregulated and typical expressive also moderately heritable with the shared environment being important at some ages. Findings support the presence of theorized biologically based temperament types that develop rapidly in infancy and toddlerhood and provide a foundation for the study of individual differences and risk and resilience processes across the lifespan.

Although early childhood is a period of rapid telomere attrition, little is known about the factors that influence telomere biology during this time. Adult research suggests that telomere length is influenced by psychological characteristics. This study’s goal was to test associations among repeated measures of temperament and telomere length in a community sample of children (N = 602; 52% male, 73% non-Hispanic White, middle-to-high socioeconomic status) from infancy to age 3 years. Relative telomere length was assessed from DNA in saliva samples collected at infancy (M = 8.4 months), 2 years (M = 24.9 months), and 3 years (M = 37.8 months). Temperament was assessed via maternal report questionnaires administered at infancy (Infant Behavior Report Questionnaire–Revised) and ages 2 and 3 years (Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire). Temperament was operationalized in two ways: using the established domains of negative affectivity, surgency/extraversion, and regulation/effortful control and using person-centered scores that identified three groups of children with similar profiles across domains (emotionally and behaviorally regulated; emotionally and behaviorally dysregulated; introverted and overcontrolled). Analyses revealed that greater regulation/effortful control was associated with longer telomere length across time points. Additionally, higher surgency/extraversion, beginning in infancy, was associated with decreased rate of telomere attrition. There were no sex differences in the relations between temperament and telomere measures. These findings suggest that, as early as infancy, temperament may influence telomere biology, with a potential protective effect of positive temperament characteristics on telomere erosion.

To explore early antecedents of this gender imbalance, the present study investigated the developmental changes in children’s social preference of boys and girls who pursue brilliance-required (vs. effort-required) activities. Importantly, we took an intersectional perspective to explore whether children consider target race in their social preference. Five- to 9-year-old U.S. children (N = 207; Mage = 7.53; 104 girls and 103 boys; 48% White) were presented with pairs of Asian, Black, and White characters matched in gender. One character was depicted as enjoying a game requiring high intellectual talents and the other enjoyed a game requiring effort. Participants were then asked to choose the character that they liked more, as an indicator of their social preference. With age, children became increasingly likely to prefer White boys and girls of color (i.e., Black and Asian girls) pursuing activities requiring brilliance (vs. activities requiring effort). In contrast, children did not develop increasing social preference for White girls or boys of color who opt in for brilliance-required activities. Our data suggest that, as early as elementary school years, children’s social preference in contexts valuing sheer brilliance becomes both gendered and racialized. These findings highlight the importance of using an intersectional approach to identify the specific developmental processes that contribute to social disparities in brilliance-required contexts.

Thus, we posed three research questions: Did classmates’ ethnic–racial discrimination from teachers predict adolescents’ classroom adjustment outcomes (e.g., class grades, test scores, and engagement), did classroom climate mediate the link between classmates’ ethnic–racial discrimination and adolescents’ classroom adjustment outcomes, and did the results differ between early versus middle adolescents? To answer these research questions, the present study leveraged longitudinal data among 1,539 adolescents (Mage = 13.81, SDage = 1.49; 60% Black, 30% White, 9% other, 1% Asian; 49% female, 51% male) nested in 104 math classrooms, as math is a subject domain with pervasive ethnic–racial stereotypes about students’ abilities and opportunities to succeed in class. Results illustrated that direct and vicarious ethnic–racial discrimination from math educators in the fall semester predicted worse math course grades, state-administered standardized test scores, and classroom engagement across the fall and spring semesters. Math classroom climate perceptions mediated the longitudinal relations between ethnic–racial discrimination and their math adjustment outcomes, and the role of ethnic–racial discrimination varied across different developmental stages of adolescence. Implications for the measurement of ethnic–racial discrimination in the classroom context and the social contagion linked to ethnic–racial disadvantage are discussed.

We investigate a novel explanation for this apparent gap between formal and informal scientific inquiry behavior. Specifically, we consider whether learners’ documented failure to correctly apply the control of variables strategy might stem from a mismatch between task presentation and their intuitions as causal learners. In Experiment 1, children (7- and 9-year-olds) and adults were tested on a version of a traditional multivariate reasoning task (Tschirgi, 1980) that was modified to clarify ambiguous elements of the causal logic in the original design. In all age groups, a significant majority of participants selected informative experiments on this modified task, avoiding confounded actions with positive tangible outcomes. In Experiment 2, we replicate these results with real-world stimuli, and in Experiments 3 and 4, we provide direct evidence that self-directed learners apply specific causal intuitions to experimentation tasks. Together, these findings support a novel alternative interpretation of the apparently paradoxical gap between learners’ success in informal exploration and their error-prone experimentation—both behaviors are consistent with an intuitively causal approach to scientific inquiry.

Yet real-time connections at home between background sound and infant–caregiver language interactions remain unexamined. We quantified background sounds in the home environment, from 1- to 2-hr video recordings of infant–mother everyday activities (infants aged 8–26 months, 36 female) in two samples: European-American, English-speaking, middle-socioeconomic status (SES) families (N = 36) and Latine, Spanish-speaking, low-SES families (N = 40). From videos, we identified and coded five types of background sound: television/screens, communication devices, music, appliances, and transportation/construction. Exposure to background sounds varied enormously among homes and was stable across a week, with television/screens and music being the most dominant type of background sounds. Infants’ vocalizations and mothers’ speech to infants were reduced in the presence of background sound (although effect sizes were small), highlighting real-time processes that affect everyday language exchanges. Over the course of a day, infants in homes with high amounts of background sounds may hear and produce less language than infants in homes with less background sounds, highlighting potential cascading influences from environmental features to everyday interactions to language learning.

The present study uses data from the Baby’s First Years randomized control trial to identify the causal impact of unconditional cash transfers on maternal reports of early childhood development. One thousand racially and ethnically diverse mothers residing in poverty were recruited from four U.S. metropolitan areas shortly after giving birth. Mothers were randomized to receive either a $333/month or $20/month unconditional cash transfer for the first several years of their child’s life. Maternal reports of language and socioemotional development, concerns for developmental delay, and enrollment in early intervention services were collected annually at the time of the child’s first, second, and third birthdays. In this registered report, we document no statistically detectable impacts of the high-cash gift on maternal reports of child development.

Prior studies have uncovered behavioral and neural correlates of statistical learning, yet additional work is needed from low- and middle-income countries to explore whether statistical learning varies across cultures or underlies associations often found between socioeconomic status (SES) and language outcomes. In the present study, we explored the feasibility of using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore auditory statistical learning in Bangladesh, a lower-middle-income country. Participants were 102 2-year-old (M = 25.72 months, SD = 2.07 months) and 125 5-year-old children (M = 62.35 months, SD = 2.46 months) living in a low-income urban neighborhood of Dhaka (average family income of 28,145.13 Bangladeshi Takas or 260.06 U.S. dollars per month). We also collected measures of SES and language outcomes. Brain responses during the statistical learning paradigm could be detected with fNIRS in both two- and 5-year-olds, with 2-year-olds exhibiting a higher response to predictable sequences and 5-year-olds exhibiting higher responses to unpredictable sequences. fNIRS correlates of statistical learning were not related to language outcomes but were associated with SES in the 5-year-old cohort. This study demonstrates the utility of employing fNIRS to study the neural correlates of statistical learning in low- and middle-income countries and the feasibility of expanding the representativeness of the existing literature. These findings also highlight potential areas for inquiry into how SES may relate to individual differences in statistical learning responses.

The present study aims to describe profiles of students with various calculation and word-problem solving skills from Grades 1 to 9, as well as the developmental trajectories of these profiles, how profiles are related to students’ further educational pathways, and whether having a specific skill profile in Grade 9 is related to the results of math and language exams at the end of Grade 12. The sample included 1,023 Estonian students who completed calculation and word-problem solving tests in Grades 1, 3, 6, and 9 (ages 6–16 years old). Educational pathway information and results of the math and language exam in Grade 12 were retrieved from the Estonian Education Information System’s registry. Socioeconomic status was determined via parental education level. Overall, results indicated that math skills were positively interrelated between the school years. However, person-oriented approach demonstrated that less than half of students tended to stay in a similar profile from Grades 1 to 9. This suggests that, in terms of math skills, most students have diverse developmental trajectories from elementary school through the end of middle school. Profiles were also related to further educational pathways and high school exam results. This study complements previous variable-oriented research to provide unique and valuable information regarding the development of math skills.

However, the nature of these associations is still unclear. For example, it is uncertain if EFs applied in the context of domain-specific mathematical cognition (i.e., EFs applied while processing numbers) are more closely related to mathematics achievement than EFs applied in nonnumerical, domain-general contexts. Also, how distinct EF domains—that is, working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility—and contents—that is, numerical versus nonnumerical—moderate the association between magnitude processing and mathematics achievement has not been fully understood. To address these issues, we investigated how magnitude processing, EFs applied to nonnumerical and numerical task stimuli, and their interactions were associated with mathematics achievement. Three hundred fifty-nine Brazilian third- to fifth-grade (8–10 years old) students completed measures of working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility with numerical and nonnumerical task versions, nonsymbolic and symbolic magnitude comparison, and mathematics achievement. A series of regression models indicated that nonsymbolic and symbolic magnitude processing are consistently associated with mathematics achievement, even when controlling for working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility measured with both numerical and nonnumerical contents. All EF measures were associated with mathematics achievement. However, cognitive flexibility measured with numerical content showed the strongest association. Results support the hypothesis that magnitude processing and EFs are uniquely associated with mathematics achievement. Furthermore, EFs measured with nonnumerical and numerical contents related differently to mathematics achievement, even when controlling for symbolic and nonsymbolic magnitude processing, suggesting they encompass somewhat distinct cognitive processes.

Cross-tabulation analyses suggested that similar developmental trends emerged within each racial/ethnic group (which were tested separately). Many adolescents maintained their high or low expectancies, interest, and utility values across Grades 9–11. Some patterns varied by belief; for example, several adolescents switched from high to low interest by Grade 11, whereas several adolescents switched from low to high utility value. Parent–adolescent discussions predicted positive changes among Asian and Latine adolescents, whereas perceived teacher unfairness predicted negative changes among Black adolescents. The findings from the present study highlight the diverse developmental trends in adolescents’ motivational beliefs and the potential role of socializers as sources of strength or challenge in their motivational belief development.

Yet, these relations may vary by a child’s ability level. This study examined how early reading skills relate to different levels of third-grade mathematics. The samples included 105 same-sex twin pairs (210 individuals, 57% female, 43% male) from the ongoing longitudinal Western Reserve Reading and Math Projects, assessed at kindergarten (M = 6.18, SD = 0.44) and third grade (M = 9.07, SD = 0.49). Kindergarten reading measures consisted of the Letter Identification task from the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test-Revised Normative Update, the Deletion subtests from Phonological Awareness Test, and the Letter Naming Fluency task from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills; third-grade math measures included Calculation, Fluency, Applied Problem, and Quantitative Concepts subtests of Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement. Both linear and quantile regressions were conducted using reading measures as predictors and math measures as the dependent variables. Linear regressions indicated that the Deletion Summary Score was a unique predictor of Applied Problems, and Letter Naming Fluency was a significant and unique predictor of Calculation Fluency and Quantitative Concepts. Quantile regressions provided a more thorough analysis of these relations. It was found that Letter Naming Fluency was significantly associated with Calculation, Calculation Fluency, and Quantitative Concepts at the lower level. The Deletion Summary Score had relatively stable relations with Applied Problems across all levels.

The intervention (vs. control) led to sustained increases in parents’ beliefs that math ability is malleable and math failure is beneficial for learning. The intervention, however, did not improve their math parenting practices or children’s math adjustment relative to the control. Instead, there were generally improvements in math parenting practices and children’s math adjustment over the course of the study regardless of condition, perhaps because the control condition provided parents with useful information about the Common Core math curriculum.
