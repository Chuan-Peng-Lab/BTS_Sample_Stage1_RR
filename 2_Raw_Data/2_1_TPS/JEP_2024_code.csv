Identifying ways to enhance mathematical instruction is crucial to understanding the ideal ways to promote academic success. Previous work has identified mathematical language (i.e., the words and concepts related to early mathematical development such as more, same, or similar) as a key mechanism that can be targeted to improve children’s development of early numeracy skills (e.g., counting, cardinality, and addition). Current recommendations suggest a combination of numeracy instruction and quantitative language instruction to promote numeracy skills. However, there is limited direct support of this recommendation. The goal of the proposed study is to compare the unique and combined effects of each type of instruction on children’s numeracy skills in the context of picture book reading. We randomly assigned 234 children (ages 3–5) to one of four conditions where they worked with trained project staff who read picture books targeting: (a) quantitative language only (e.g., more or less), (b) numeracy only (e.g., cardinality, addition), (c) combined [quantitative language + numeracy], or (d) nonnumerical (active control) picture books. Results revealed no significant effects of the quantitative language only or numeracy only conditions, but mixed effects of the combined condition. These findings indicate that more work is needed on how mathematical language and numeracy instruction should best be delivered to preschool children.

Data were collected at four time points over one academic year. We tested two reciprocal effects models relating student perceptions of autonomy-supportive teaching and their agentic engagement: a between-person cross-lag-panel model (CLPM) and a within-person CLPM with random intercept. Both models supported the bidirectional reciprocal relations between perceived autonomy-supportive teaching and agentic engagement. Based on student perceptions, prior agentic engagement led to increased autonomy-supportive teaching and prior autonomy-supportive teaching led to greater agentic engagement.

Using intensive longitudinal data, the present article examines the link between university students’ autonomous study motivation with affective well-being and targets fulfillment of the basic psychological needs as a potential mediating factor of this association on the within-person and the between-person level. University students in Germany (N = 488) completed an online questionnaire once a week over up to two semesters, indicating their weekly study motivation, need fulfillment, and affective well-being. Multilevel structural equation models were employed to target (a) the structure of autonomous study motivation and (b) the associations of autonomous study motivation with need fulfillment and affective well-being. Autonomous study motivation was associated with students’ positive and negative affect on both levels. In line with predictions by self-determination theory, multilevel mediation models suggested indirect effects via need fulfillment on both levels. Results highlight the central role of autonomous study motivation and need fulfillment in university students’ socioemotional adjustment. A better understanding of this socioemotional adjustment of university students may be an important step for increasing overall study satisfaction and developing interventions to reduce study dropout.

Effect sizes and other information (e.g., engagement measures) were retrieved from 137 studies involving 158,510 participants. The systematic review showed that the three engagement dimensions could be further distinguished into seven conceptually distinct engagement subtypes. Metaregression with robust variance estimation revealed that student engagement has a large average correlation with academic achievement (r = .33) and SWB (r = .35). Upon closer inspection, academic achievement has the strongest association with behavioral engagement (r = .39), followed by cognitive (r = .31) and affective (r = .26) engagement. SWB, in contrast, was most closely related to affective engagement (r = .40), followed by cognitive (r = .35) and behavioral (r = .31) engagement. Further analyses indicated that the magnitude of these effect sizes was moderated by the ways affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement were operationalized in the primary studies, as well as other factors like the informant source of engagement and type of achievement measure used. While the present study showed that student engagement was positively associated with desirable student outcomes, it also illustrated how student engagement is, at the current point in time, overgeneralized and in dire need of conceptual refinement.

This approach to news makes people susceptible to the vast amounts of misinformation online, yet research on the effects of this kind of engagement is mixed. More research is needed on technology incidental learning effects, defined as changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors as a result of being exposed to information while pursuing goals other than learning (e.g., entertainment). In this study, we examined how 51 college students responded to incidental exposure to accurate and inaccurate COVID-19 information delivered via a simulated social media environment. Participants’ verbalizations during think-aloud protocols indicated numerous mental processes including cognition, metacognition, epistemic cognition, motivation, and emotions. Positively valanced mental processing was more often expressed with accurate COVID-19 information and negatively valanced mental processing was more often verbalized with misinformation. Negatively valanced evaluations of knowledge claims and sources predicted less engagement with COVID-19 misinformation posts. However, in many cases the relations among verbalized mental processing and behavioral responses were complex or nonobvious. For example, participants’ positive metacognition and epistemic cognition verbalizations decreased their likelihood of engaging with accurate COVID-19 information, whereas positive interest was associated with an increased likelihood of engaging with misinformation. Our findings have implications for how to accurately infer people’s beliefs and intentions from their social media behaviors and how to design interventions to help people be more active and thoughtful consumers of online information.

Even though it is widely acknowledged that bilingual children are not a homogenous group, existing studies on dual-language profiles in bilingual children have focused on expressive language profiles. In this study, we used the normative data from the Quick Interactive Language Screener: English–Spanish (QUILS:ES; de Villiers et al., 2021; Iglesias et al., 2021) and latent profile analysis to identify dual-language profiles in receptive language skills in a large sample of Spanish–English bilingual preschoolers. We also examined demographic, dual-language experience, and home literacy environment factors that contributed to receptive dual-language profile membership. The optimal model represents a three-profile solution, including a balanced-low profile, an English-dominant average profile, and a balanced-high profile. Comparing participants’ profile membership against their age and risk status for language impairment based on the QUILS:ES screening results, we found that while being in an older age group significantly increases a child’s likelihood of being in a balanced-high profile, an older child displaying a balanced-low profile is at a higher risk for language impairment. Age, socioeconomic status, and home literacy environment factors were found to be associated with strong dual-language skills, whereas (relative) dual-language experience did not predict profile membership. Together, these findings extend previous work that examined the heterogeneity within Spanish–English bilingual children by demonstrating substantial variability in their receptive language skills and providing insights into malleable factors that may be targeted to support dual-language development.

However, there is limited understanding of contextual factors associated with the formation of DLL profiles. This study extends previous work by examining within-group variability in Spanish–English speaking DLLs’ (n = 330) cognitive, linguistic, literacy, and math skills at the end of prekindergarten (M = 5.09 years old), their family (n = 313) characteristics, and their classrooms (n = 84). Using latent profile analysis, we identified four profiles of DLLs (English dominant, balanced average, Spanish dominant, emerging bilinguals), four profiles of parents (low parent education, high mother education, high parent education, high father education), and two profiles of classrooms (teachers with high education with high training and teachers with low education with low training). In general, the balanced average child profile outperformed the other child profiles in English and Spanish, and their norm-referenced standard scores provide additional evidence that bilingual development is not associated with educational risk. There was not a statistically significant correspondence between the parent and child profiles; however, the correspondence between the teacher and child profiles suggests that over half of the children taught by teachers with high education and training are in balanced average or Spanish-dominant profiles. A larger proportion of DLLs in the emerging-bilingual profile are in classrooms with teachers characterized by low education and little professional development as compared to the other three profiles.

Latent class growth analysis revealed five distinct growth trajectories of English reading scores across elementary grades. Results showed a fan-spread effect, indicating that children with higher mean reading scores in kindergarten also had faster growth in English reading from kindergarten to Grade 5. Results also showed that children with high early Spanish reading were more likely to be a member of the classes with the highest initial English reading scores and fastest growth rates. However, kindergarten English oral proficiency was not related to trajectories of English reading.

Previous meta-analytic research has evidenced the “screen inferiority effect”: Readers tend to understand texts slightly worse when reading on-screen than when reading the same text in print. Most primary studies from those meta-analyses used computers as on-screen reading devices. Accordingly, the extent to which handheld devices, which provide a reading experience closer to books than computers, are affected by the screen inferiority effect remains an open question. To address this issue, we reviewed relevant literature regarding potential moderating factors for the screen inferiority effect through the lenses of the reading for understanding framework. We then performed two meta-analyses aimed at examining the differences in reading comprehension when reading on handheld devices, as compared to print. Results from the two multilevel random-effect meta-analyses, which included primary studies that used either between-participant (k = 38, g = −0.113) or within-participant (k = 21, g = −0.103) designs, consistently showed a significant small size effect favoring print text comprehension. Moderator analyses helped to partially clarify the results, indicating in some cases a higher screen inferiority effect for undergraduate students (as compared to primary and secondary school students) and for participants who were assessed individually (as opposed to in groups). We discuss the need to continue fostering print reading in schools while developing effective ways to incorporate handheld devices for reading purposes.

Across 2 days, 280 fifth-grade students learned from a difficult lesson on ratio, half of whom reviewed worked examples at key problem-solving opportunities during instruction. We also measured two sources of students’ worry during learning: math anxiety and worries about learning during the pandemic. We explored the attentional and affective effects of worked examples and worries in addition to their effects on learning. Results suggest that math anxiety, but not pandemic learning worries, negatively predicted procedural and conceptual learning from the lesson. In line with previous research and cognitive load theory, math anxiety also predicted greater mind wandering during testing and lower situational interest during learning. Critically, reviewing worked examples during learning mitigated these effects on learning and engagement. Pandemic-related learning worries were unrelated to learning outcomes but did predict affective and motivational outcomes. Educational implications are discussed.

Although prior work has focused on measuring students’ procedural flexibility using arithmetic problems, word problems may also capture students’ flexibility because of their open-ended nature. To date, no published study has examined the use of word problems as another measure of procedural flexibility. The present study aims to establish flexibility on fraction word problems as a predictor of algebra learning and to determine whether flexibility demonstrated on fraction arithmetic versus fraction word problems differentially predicts two types of algebra learning (e.g., algebraic feature knowledge and algebra equation-solving). Middle-school students (N = 350) completed fraction arithmetic problems, fraction word problems, and algebra measures at the start and end of the school year. We coded fraction arithmetic and word problems for demonstrated procedural flexibility. Path models showed that overall flexibility significantly predicted both algebraic feature knowledge and equation-solving. When examining flexibility by type, procedural flexibility on arithmetic problems significantly predicted end-of-year algebraic feature knowledge and algebra equation-solving, whereas procedural flexibility on word problems significantly predicted algebraic feature knowledge. Procedural flexibility on arithmetic problems was still predictive of performance when accounting for fraction magnitude skill. These findings build on prior literature that establishes procedural flexibility as a crucial predictor of algebra learning and extends measures of procedural flexibility to include word problems.

MD are multifaceted, and several factors are involved in their manifestation. This makes the accurate early prediction of MD particularly challenging. In the present study, we aim to predict MD in Grade 6 with kindergarten-age (age 6) measures by applying a neural networks model. We use a set of 49 variables assessed during kindergarten from the domains of early arithmetic skills, cognitive skills, the home learning environment, parental measures, motivation, behavioral problems, and gender, which have been shown to have associations with mathematical development and/or MD. A two-step approach was used: First, we examined whether the neural networks approach can provide a solution for the effective early identification of MD based on all 49 variables and, then, by using the most important predictors as identified by the initial model. The initial model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of .818, demonstrating excellent performance. The most important predictors of Grade 6 MD came from the domains of arithmetic and cognitive skills (arithmetic skills, rapid automatized naming, number concepts, spatial skills, counting) and behavioral problems (attention-orientation). The model with only the most important predictors achieved an AUC of .776, indicating good performance. Our results provided proof of concept for using neural networks in MD prediction in Grade 6 using information already available in kindergarten. In schools, these results could be used to identify children at potential risk of developing MD and to provide access to early support.

This study also seeks to document the longitudinal associations between these profiles and various indicators of students’ school functioning (engagement, achievement) and behavioral adaptation (hyperactivity–inattention, opposition–defiance, internalizing behaviors). Latent profile analyses identified five profiles replicated among boys and girls in language and mathematics classes. However, the prevalence of these profiles differed slightly as a function of sex and subject: Low-all climate (10.01%–19.71%), High-all climate (8.65%–14.82%), Performance climate (26.70%–36.22%), Low performance climate (12.93%–24.84%), and Mastery and positive social climate (19.42%–27.61%). The Mastery and positive social climate and the Low performance climate were associated with the highest levels of school functioning and the lowest levels of behavioral adaptation problems. The Low-all climate and the performance climate were conversely associated with low levels of school functioning and high levels of behavioral adaptation problems. Overall, during the school year, engagement decreased, achievement remained stable, and behavior problems increased. Specific changes within each profile are discussed. Girls were more likely to report exposure to classroom climates associated with the most favorable outcomes, whereas the opposite was true for boys. Considering the multidimensional nature of classroom climate, these results have important theoretical and educational implications for promoting student adaptation.

However, a recent meta-analysis showed that most of these studies suffered from serious methodological shortcomings, as they failed to account for knowledge growth over time, possible ceiling effects for learners with high prior knowledge, moderating effects of learning environments, and possible confounds between intelligence or traits that refer to intellectual investment and prior knowledge. The present study avoided these limitations. A total of 922 students were tested with progressively more difficult Rasch-scaled knowledge tests at four measurement points from Grades 5 to 7. The relation between prior knowledge and knowledge growth in six learning environments (i.e., mathematics, German, and English in regular and gifted classes) was investigated using multigroup latent growth curve models with and without controlling for students’ intelligence and the intellectual investment trait of need for cognition. In regular classes, prior knowledge negatively predicted knowledge gains in all subjects. In gifted classes, prior knowledge negatively predicted knowledge gains only in German and English, and need for cognition positively predicted knowledge gains in mathematics but not in German or English. The results indicate that school instruction is designed to help all students reach the predefined learning goals and pass criterion-oriented tests. As a result, students with low prior knowledge tend to learn more than high prior knowledge students. More research is needed on how these processes are modulated by learning environments and are intertwined with students’ intelligence and their intellectual investment.

Using a longitudinal research design, we explored the stability of hand raising and its directional relations with student learner characteristics over time. We observed students’ hand-raising behavior using video-recordings of 376 German high school students taken in multiple lessons during one school year. Results show that student hand raising seems to be a stable student behavior; nearly half of the variance observed is attributable to individual students, while less is attributable to lessons and classroom teachers. A latent cross-lagged panel analysis revealed reciprocal dynamics between hand-raising, cognitive, and motivational learner characteristics. Specifically, hand raising functioned as both an antecedent and an outcome of students’ cognitive elaboration, while frequent hand raising at the beginning of the school year positively predicted changes in students’ academic self-concept. Therefore, hand raising seems to be associated with opportunities that stimulate positive changes in students’ cognitive and competence-related learning experiences.

Effects of context and beliefs about science on college students’ document selection","Journal of Educational Psychology","","1939-2176","10.1037/edu0000849","","Previous research on document selection has found that college-level readers are generally able to differentiate trustworthy from less trustworthy sources. Yet, a preference for selecting trustworthy sources may depend on features of the reading situation and readers’ beliefs in science. In the current study, college students were tasked with selecting documents for either a university assignment or a personal project (external context manipulation) using documents that varied in the type of source (i.e., a source with scientific expertise or a source with personal experiences) as a within-participants manipulation. Moreover, participants’ beliefs about science and knowledge about how science works were assessed. In two experiments (N = 165 and N = 125), participants selected documents for further reading for four target topics. In Experiment 2, a personal condition was added that included mention of an external audience for the assignment. Like in previous studies, participants in both experiments preferred scientific-expertise sources over personal-experiences sources. However, their likelihood of selecting a personal-experiences source was higher in a personal context without an external audience (compared to university context). More positive beliefs about science as well as knowledge about how science works were associated with a lower probability of selecting sources with personal experiences. Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 and extended the findings regarding external context. Although college-level readers generally prefer scientific sources, their selection of sources without scientific expertise also depends on the external reading context as well as on personal beliefs and knowledge about science.

It also examined how this impact varies by grade, text genre, and processing level. A sample of 430 Chinese children in Grades 2, 4, and 6 was observed over a period of 6 months. For each grade, longitudinal hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the unique contribution of ToM to reading comprehension across different text genres and processing levels. By controlling for variables such as reading frequency, decoding, vocabulary, nonverbal intelligence, listening comprehension, and executive function, ToM cannot predict the overall reading comprehension of children in Grade 2, but can predict it of children in Grades 4 and 6. For specific text genres, ToM predicted narrative comprehension in both Grades 4 and 6 and expository comprehension only in Grade 6. For specific processing levels, ToM predicted advanced comprehension in Grades 4 and 6 and basic comprehension only in Grade 6. Furthermore, ToM predicted advanced narrative and expository comprehension in Grades 4 and 6, and basic expository comprehension in Grade 6. These findings highlight the important role of ToM in reading comprehension development, particularly in the middle and upper stages of primary school. These results lay the foundation for further research on exploring the underlying mechanisms of the impact of ToM on reading comprehension and provide a social-cognitive perspective to enhance the development of reading comprehension.

Yet for many students, simply receiving evidence-based reading instruction in a small-group setting is insufficient to reach the progress milestones needed to meet grade-level reading standards. The current study examined whether (a) elementary school students with RD constitute homogeneous or heterogeneous groups when considering their basic language and cognitive skills (using a latent profile analysis) and (b) latent profiles are predictive of response to reading comprehension instruction (using a mixed modeling approach). The sample consisted of 335 students, including students with RD and typical students (n = 57). The results revealed heterogeneity within students with RD—there were two distinct profiles, with one having higher basic language (reading fluency and decoding) and cognitive (verbal domain productivity, cognitive flexibility, and working memory) skills and lower attention skills and the other having stronger attention skills and lower basic language and cognitive skills. The findings also suggested that latent profiles were predictive of response to reading comprehension instruction. Our results provide a convincing argument for leading the field in the direction of developing customized interventions. It is conceivable, but remains to be further examined, that researchers and educators could potentially improve reading outcomes through providing a customized reading intervention to a student based on their cognitive–language profile.

Latent class growth analyses revealed three empirically distinct growth trajectories: (a) consistently accurate students who displayed high accuracy across time; (b) high-growth students who demonstrated low initial accuracy but made subsequent growth; and (c) low-growth students who demonstrated consistently poor accuracy across time. Age and whole number calculation fluency predicted membership in the consistently accurate and high-growth classes relative to membership in the low-growth class. Language and nonverbal reasoning skills were identified as predictors of student membership in the consistently accurate versus low-growth class. Low-growth students displayed more whole number bias and calculation errors compared with students who demonstrated growth.

Six MD subtypes were classified: the symbolic and concept deficits group, the verbal and concept deficits group, the pervasive deficits group, the concept deficits group, the mapping and concept deficits group, and the unknown deficits group. The reliability and validity of using CDMs to identify MD subtypes were evaluated. Different constellations of working memory, spatial, and linguistic skills were found to contribute to different MD subtypes.

Socioeconomic disparities in numerical skills are visible before children begin school, and widen throughout schooling. It is, therefore, important to support the development of early numerical skills in children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Previous studies have highlighted the effectiveness of linear number board games for improving early numerical skills, and the beneficial effect of counting backward as well as forward. We designed a number board game that required children to place number cards in order on a line, either forward-only or forward and backward in small groups in the classroom. The game’s effectiveness was evaluated in 4- to 5-year-old children from schools located in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Children were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: playing the number game forward-only (n = 82), playing the number game forward and backward (i.e., bidirectional condition; n = 82), or an alphabet game (active control, n = 85). After eight gameplay sessions across 5 weeks, children’s numerical and letter-sound knowledge skills improved, but there was no significant effect of the intervention condition. Neither forward nor bidirectional number line games (nor the alphabet game) added benefits beyond the learning already happening in the classroom. Short linear board game interventions may be effective compared to control groups who received minimal or absent numerical education, but they fail to provide an additional advantage when children are already learning mathematics in school.

Participants were 590 undergraduates (38% women; 65% European American, 24% Asian/Pacific Islander, 11% underrepresented minorities) who were enrolled in engineering coursework. We used structural equation modeling to examine the independent and interactive associations of students’ BPN satisfaction (competence, relatedness, and autonomy) with their help-seeking behavior. Findings indicate that strong relatedness with both the instructor and peers are uniquely and differentially associated with specific types of adaptive help seeking (oriented to learning) and maladaptive help seeking (avoidance or asking for the answer), whereas competence and autonomy primarily explained differences in maladaptive types of help seeking. Moreover, many of these associations were dependent on students’ relatedness with their instructor. Additional multigroup analyses revealed that instructor relatedness was especially critical for understanding women’s help seeking. Results indicate that experiencing relatedness in college STEM programs—particularly positive relationships with instructors—is crucial for students’ adaptive help seeking in difficult courses, while minimizing their maladaptive help-seeking behavior.

Moving beyond past work, this study examined their effects both at the level of between-student differences and at the level of semester-to-semester fluctuations within students’ own functioning, thereby controlling for students’ cognitive ability. The study had a four-wave longitudinal design, following 3,415 seventh-grade students across a 2-year period with 6-month intervals (49.8% female; Mage = 12.65 years). Multilevel analyses demonstrated that autonomous motivation and effort beliefs had independent and favorable associations with most outcomes and that controlled motivation and a fixed mindset related more uniquely to maladaptive outcomes, findings that emerged at both levels of analysis. This pattern of associations was held after controlling for students’ cognitive ability and applied to both students with high and low cognitive ability. The number of interactions between motivation and mindsets was quite limited. It can be concluded that the quality of motivation and mindsets about intelligence represent compatible resources for learning that help to explain between-student and within-student differences in learning and achievement.

Studies 3a (N = 266) and 3b (N = 320) revealed associations between the Mindfulness Mindset Scale and other measures of mindset, trait mindfulness, and coping, showing reasonable convergent and divergent validity. Study 4 (N = 470) showed the predictive validity of the mindfulness mindset, being correlated with behavioral persistence, effort, resilience, challenge-seeking, and academic grades. Study 5 (N = 320) supported the academic correlates of malleable beliefs of mindfulness beyond the mental health factors from Study 3 in two countries.

These behavioral results suggest that beliefs about mindfulness being malleable are a novel construct distinct from trait mindfulness. Such beliefs are related to adaptive psychological mechanisms relevant in educational contexts, considering students’ coping, mastery behavior, and academic performance. Importantly, these beliefs can be modified by brief interventions.

The current study examined African American students’ perceptions of their mathematics teachers’ practice specifically related to the transmission of communal values, communal socialization. It also explores associations between these perceptions and students’ academic engagement and performance in mathematics. Communal socialization is the transmission of implicit and explicit messages, models, and experiences that teach, honor, and reinforce students’ values of social connectedness, interdependence, and common purpose. African American high school students (N = 308, 81% 14–17 years old, 74% female, 71% subsidized lunch status) participated in this study. Exploratory factor analyses were used to examine the dimensionality of communal socialization. Latent profile analyses yielded profiles to explore the varied experiences of students in secondary mathematics. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between communal socialization and students’ academic (i.e., academic engagement and performance), achievement motivation (i.e., attainment value), and social responsibility outcomes. Results were in support of the multidimensional nature of the Communal Socialization Scale including four factors: personal responsibility, community utility, equitable actions, and global responsibility. In addition, four latent profiles emerged, each with distinct levels in these factors: highly communal, moderately communal, least critical, and least communal. Students in the highly communal socialization profile reported significantly more value for mathematics, academic engagement, and perceived higher social responsibility. As a culturally sustaining practice, communal socialization has the potential to shape mathematics instruction toward fostering and sustaining social and community connections for the benefit of students’ value, engagement, and persistence in mathematics.

However, empirical results for each approach have been mixed and these approaches have worked differently for different groups of students. In the present study, we combined the affordances of personalization with those of UV interventions to create novel activities where students posed mathematics problems based on their career and popular culture interests. While problem-posing has been identified as a powerful approach in the mathematics education literature, it is an effortful activity for learners, inducing demands described by theories related to desirable difficulties. We conducted a randomized control study with 458 middle school, high school, and college students enrolled in algebra courses with overlapping content to examine the impact of the personalized problem-posing intervention. Results showed that when controlling for dosage the intervention had statistically significant positive effects on algebra learning compared to a business-as-usual condition where students solved typical story problems in the same online platform. Posing problems based on popular culture interests was especially effective for learning for college students. However, for secondary school students, posing popular culture problems had significantly negative effects on their feelings of mathematics enjoyment. In addition, there was evidence that a subset of learners who completed a small dosage of the intervention had negative effects on their valuing of mathematics. Implications for interest development theory, personalized and UV interventions, and mathematical problem-posing designs are discussed.

This might be especially relevant for mathematical word problems that pose high mental demands in a multistage solution process. Existing studies further indicate that contrary to expectations of practitioners, static decorative pictures (DPs) do not improve students’ affective state. It is unclear if dynamic DPs that decorate each segment of a word problem better meet these expectations. In our preregistered online experiment that involved 308 students in a 3 × 2 mixed design, we manipulated word problems regarding three visualization conditions (RPs vs. DPs vs. text-only), and two kinds of dynamics (static vs. dynamic). As expected, static and dynamic RPs increased response correctness, metacognitive ratings, and satisfaction compared to text-only. Besides this replication and extension of the multimedia effect in testing, dynamic RPs did not outperform static RPs in direct comparisons, however. Both RP conditions did not extend the time-on-task compared to text-only. As expected, static DPs did neither increase response correctness nor metacognition nor satisfaction compared to text-only. However, dynamic DPs were also unable to increase satisfaction compared to text only. Additional analyses that took the item position into account unveiled that the time-on-task in dynamic DP items aligned to that of text-only items over the course of the experiment, so that the students might have ignored dynamic DPs over time. Finally, we conclude implications for using these visualizations in digital assessments.

SEM analysis revealed that students’ domain-specific vocabulary knowledge in first and second grade explained 69% of the treatment effect on a domain-specific reading comprehension outcome. Results from the quantitative survey also indicated that treatment group teachers reported providing more incidental exposures to vocabulary than control teachers (effect size = .54), and qualitative analyses revealed that teachers with high incidental exposures tended to provide expanded opportunities for their students to engage with words and to connect words to topics.

We identified 56 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (N = 5,088), including 81 independent samples and 138 effect sizes. Using robust variance estimation, inference instruction had a moderate, positive effect (g = 0.495, p g = 0.28) may be less effective than when students read the text independently (g = 0.79) during instruction. Finally, study quality was evaluated as a moderator using six characteristics of quality, and no significant differences in effect size were found between studies of higher quality and those of lower quality. Thus, this review suggests that regardless of age, reading ability, type of instruction, and text, inference instruction would be worthy of implementation.

In the present study, we examined the relations among writing quality; the writing production process measured by writing fluency; and language, cognitive, and transcription skills, using longitudinal data from English-speaking beginning writers who were followed from kindergarten to Grade 2 (N = 261). Children’s working memory, attentional control, spelling, handwriting fluency, vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and writing quality were measured in kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2. Writing fluency was measured in Grade 2 in two ways, using a process-based measure, writing burst length (chunks of text produced between pauses during writing), and a product-based measure, the number of words produced per total writing time. Results from structural equation modeling showed that Grade 2 writing fluency was moderately related to Grade 2 writing quality (.40) and completely mediated the relations of Grade 1 spelling and handwriting fluency skills to Grade 2 writing quality. In contrast, Grade 1 vocabulary was directly related to Grade 2 writing quality over and above Grade 2 writing fluency. Kindergarten working memory was indirectly related to Grade 2 writing fluency via Grade 1 spelling skill. These findings indicate that the writing production process measured by writing fluency mediates the relations of transcription skills to writing quality, and executive function is indirectly related to writing fluency via transcription skills for beginning writers.

Key to DBI’s success is making instructional changes based on individual students’ progress monitoring data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of such instructional changes on student early writing outcomes. We applied a piecewise linear–linear mixed-effects (PLME) model to determine student writing growth trajectories before and after teachers introduced instructional changes. Using data from 46 elementary school students with intensive writing intervention needs, results showed that a PLME model with two segmented slopes—before and after the change—best explained students’ observed change in writing scores. Results also showed that a higher level of initial writing skills was associated with higher levels of intercepts and additional growth gains after the instructional change, whereas the type of instructional change was not associated with predicted writing trajectories. We discuss the implications of positive effects of teachers’ individualized timely decisions to change instruction using progress monitoring data as well as unexpected findings and study limitations such as small sample size and inconsistency in results.

To this end, children (N = 429) in Grades 1, 2, and 3 in southwest U.S. school districts at Wave 1 were administered a battery of cognitive (short-term memory [STM], WM, rapid naming, inhibition), domain-general nonmath (reading, vocabulary, and fluid intelligence) and domain-specific math measures (arithmetic computation, estimation, and magnitude judgment) in both Spanish (L1) and English (L2). These same measures were administered 1 and 2 years later. Four important findings emerged: (a) A three-factor structure (phonological STM, visual–spatial WM, and executive WM) captured the data across three testing waves within and across both language systems; (b) growth in phonological STM and executive WM uniquely predicted WPS growth, but these two WM structures interacted within the English language system; (c) Spanish verbal WM (phonological STM, executive WM) enhanced the magnitude of predictions of English verbal WM on English WPS; and (d) growth in language-specific phonological STM and executive WM predicted cross-sectional and within-child changes in WPS independent of growth in other domain-specific and domain-general academic areas. Taken together, the results suggest that language-specific age-related phonological STM growth and executive WM growth rates underlie Spanish and English math word problem-solving performance. The results extend the contribution of development models as a function of WM structures across two language systems as they apply to complex math performance.

This study’s conceptual model specifies that both SES and SRLS positively predict CAF, and SES moderates the relationship between SRLS and CAF. This study collected questionnaire data and argumentative writing samples from 381 Chinese university students and analyzed the data using partial correlation and structural equation modeling. The results showed that SES and SRLS were significantly related to complexity and accuracy but not to fluency. SES significantly moderated the relationship between SRLS and writing complexity and accuracy but not fluency. SES’s moderating effects on the relationship between SRLS and complexity and accuracy increased from low SES to middle SES to high SES. SES’s moderating effects on both SRLS’s and SRLS facets’ relation to fluency were complex and mostly nonsignificant. The implications of these findings are discussed, and limitations are noted.

Disentangling different components of stability and change using the STARTS model","Journal of Educational Psychology","","1939-2176","10.1037/edu0000852","","Teachers’ emotional exhaustion is related to various detrimental outcomes, such as work absenteeism, intention to quit, impaired instructional quality, and lower student motivation. Since emotional exhaustion becomes evident as early as teacher training at university, the question is whether it would be possible to identify an individual disposition to this burnout symptom in student teachers. Accordingly, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the genesis, stability, and trajectories of change of emotional exhaustion. In the present study, we have disentangled different components of longitudinal stability in emotional exhaustion by applying STable, AutoRegressive Trait, and State models to two longitudinal samples of German student teachers (Sample 1: N = 4,510; Sample 2: N = 2,034). Over the timespan of up to 6 years, we found that completely stable sources (Sample 1: 35%; Sample 2: 37%) and slowly changing factors (Sample 1: 46%; Sample 2: 36%) in student teachers’ emotional exhaustion accounted for much of the total variance in interindividual differences; occasion-specific factors and measurement error accounted for the remaining variation (Sample 1: 23%; Sample 2: 30%). This variance composition applied equally to male and female students and indicated that student teachers’ emotional exhaustion comprises a stable component but is predominantly characterized by malleable parts due to systematically changing and occasion-specific sources of variance. Our findings about the stability of emotional exhaustion contribute to the trait-state debate of psychological characteristics and point out that intervention measures should be employed at an early stage to mitigate the negative consequences of burnout in subsequent career steps.

Racial–ethnic discrimination in the school environment is common, and the perpetrators are often teachers who may treat racial–ethnic minority students unfairly. This work used a three-level multilevel approach to meta-analytically synthesize existing evidence with the aim to (a) document the links between perceived teacher-based racial–ethnic discrimination (TBRED) and students’ psychological, behavioral, and physical well-being, substance use, grade point average and school motivation, and (b) to examine whether these associations differ by sample and study characteristics. Based on 68 studies and 259 effect size estimates, we found that perceived TBRED is linked to lower well-being (r = −.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−.18, −.12]), higher substance use (r = .13, 95% CI [.06, .20]), and lower academic performance (r = −.16, 95% CI [−.20, −.13]) with substantial heterogeneity across effect sizes. Similarly, TBRED had small-to-medium negative associations within each domain of well-being and academics. The results were partially moderated by school racial–ethnic composition, suggestive of a protective function of a higher concentration of racial–ethnic minority students. In addition, more reliable scales and a greater number of items measuring TBRED were associated with stronger negative correlations with well-being. These findings highlight the importance of increasing awareness around issues of racism and discrimination in initial teacher training and professional development. We encourage further exploration of effect size heterogeneity and call for research on TBRED outside the United States.

Although it is suggested that long-term engagement in such activities could have a broad influence on several STEM-related constructs, so far little is known about the impact of unstructured OST science engagement. The current study therefore investigated the effects of unstructured OST science engagement on the development of vocational interests, occupational aspirations, competencies, school achievement, and ability self-concepts. For this purpose, we used a large longitudinal subsample (N = 2,655) from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS; Blossfeld & Roßbach, 2019) where students in Germany were assessed in Grades 9, 11, and 12. Following the recommendations of VanderWeele et al. (2020), we used an outcome-wide longitudinal design for causal inference: Outcome-wide effects of unstructured OST science activities were estimated while controlling for a set of joint confounders and pretest measures. Our findings show that unstructured OST science activities influence investigative vocational interests, but do not influence occupational aspirations, competencies, school grades, and ability self-concepts. The results suggest that adolescents with similar initial interest trait levels who engage in unstructured OST science activities develop a stronger interest toward STEM, compared to adolescents who do not engage in such activities.

Mathematical achievement varies depending on the student’s socioeconomic status (SES). However, the extent of the SES gap for specific mathematical skills remains unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we examined age variations by SES in three mathematical skills, applied problem-solving, arithmetic fluency, and written calculations, among students aged 7–12 in a socioeconomically segregated educational context. The contributions of the home environment and schools on SES gaps were also explored. The analytical sample comprised 10,665 students (49.2% girls, Mage = 10.1, SD = 1.3 years, 13.4% from Indigenous ethnic groups) from the Chilean Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (Encuesta Longitudinal de Primera Infancia). Linear models revealed SES gaps across the three mathematical tasks at the beginning of primary education. The widest gap was observed in written calculations, which was moderated by the home environment. The findings also showed an exponential increase with age in the SES gap for written calculations and arithmetic fluency. However, for applied problem-solving, the initial gap increased and remained constant. Furthermore, schools accounted for 19%–21% of the variance related to the change of the SES gap in all three mathematical skills. The findings shed some light on the role of the home environment and the schools in maintaining, increasing, or decreasing socioeconomic gaps in specific mathematical skills at different ages.

In this study, we utilized a large longitudinal data set (N = 1,092) to test whether past grades, gender, and the math level of mothers’ and fathers’ occupations predicted the math-relatedness of German adolescents’ occupational aspirations 1 year later in 10th grade controlling for mathematical competence, intelligence, and socioeconomic status, among other factors. First, we examined whether motivational beliefs—math intrinsic value and math ability self-concept—mediated these relationships. Second, we used a latent interaction approach to test whether intrinsic value and ability self-concept interacted to predict the math-relatedness of aspirations, an important yet understudied prediction of expectancy-value theories. The intrinsic value of math, but not ability self-concept fully mediated the effect of math grade on aspirations. Gender differences could partly be explained via intrinsic value, but a substantial effect remained. The math level of mothers’, but not fathers’ occupations was positively associated with the math-relatedness of their children’s aspirations, but this effect was not mediated by motivational beliefs.

Many reading interventions, both from traditional classroom settings and computer-based contexts, have focused on much needed strategy instruction but have simultaneously neglected a focus on motivation. Alternatively, game-based learning environments (GBLEs) have the potential to simultaneously address both motivation and strategy use. Currently, there are few available GBLEs that target expository text comprehension. For this reason, this study employed a quasi-experimental between-subjects media comparison design to examine the effects of Missions with Monty, a GBLE supporting metacomprehension for expository science texts, on reading comprehension and motivation. Fifth-grade students (N = 234) engaged with either Missions with Monty or a comparison, computer-based version of the program lacking gamified elements for a period of 6 weeks and were assessed on reading comprehension skills and five dimensions of reading motivation. Results indicated that students in the GBLE condition showed significantly greater improvements in reading comprehension (g = 0.56), intrinsic motivation for reading (g = 0.52), and curiosity (g = 1.11) than their comparison-condition peers. Moreover, effects of the intervention on reading motivation were independent of prior reading comprehension for each of the reading motivation dimensions except reading efficacy. These findings support the notion that GBLEs can be an effective tool to foster digital expository text comprehension, particularly for struggling and uninterested readers.

To date, the uniqueness and strength of this relationship has remained unclear because most studies have been conducted in opaque orthographies such as English, and few studies have controlled for all of the strongest cognitive and linguistic predictors of reading acquisition. Critically, PAL is a complex task involving different components, and there is still no consensus on which is more involved, crossmodal associative learning or verbal learning, although the latter has received much support in the literature. The first aim of this study was to test the unique contribution of PAL in French, which has an intermediate level of orthographic transparency compared to other languages. The second aim of this study was to disentangle the mechanisms that account for this relationship. A battery of reading and reading-related tests as well as a visual–verbal PAL task were administered to 227 French children in first and second grade. The results showed that PAL makes a unique contribution to word reading in French, but not to nonword reading scores, over and above the strongest language predictors of reading: phonological awareness, rapid automatic naming, short-term phonological memory, vocabulary, and age. Our data do not support the putative involvement of the crossmodal associative learning mechanism. We therefore suggest that verbal learning explains the entire contribution of PAL.

Research suggests that metacognitive competences (i.e., the knowledge about as well as monitoring and regulation of one’s own cognitive processes) are positively related to reading performance and may play a role in the prevalence of mind-wandering. However, whether metacognitive training can reduce task-unrelated thoughts and their negative impact on comprehension performance has yet to be investigated. The main objective of the present study was to investigate whether metacognitive training is effective in reducing participants’ task-unrelated thoughts during reading. Participants (N = 80 undergraduate students) were randomly assigned to the metacognitive training or control training condition. The effects of the interventions were examined by measuring self-reported mind-wandering, unusually fast or slow reading times as an index for inattentive reading, and comprehension on the textbase and situation model level before and after training. Results revealed less self-reported mindless reading and fewer instances of unusually fast or slow reading times after the metacognitive training but not after the control training. The metacognitive condition showed no significant change in comprehension performance from pretest to posttest, whereas the control condition exhibited a decline. Our results further indicate that mind-wandering is reflected in aberrantly slow but not fast sentence reading times. Results of the present study suggest that in addition to the previously established positive effects of metacognitive training on reading performance, the training is also effective in reducing task-unrelated thoughts during reading.

Research in this field has mostly focused on English-speaking families and has not taken into consideration cultural differences that contextualize the home environment. Measuring HNE in more ethnically diverse samples might counter results that are biased from using a deficit perspective. Given the growth of the Latine population in the United States, there is a need to redefine family engagement in numeracy and update the HNE measures to increase their cultural relevance. This mixed methods study used a strengths-based framework to develop an HNE measure for Latine families. Fourteen Latine caregivers were interviewed (57% mothers) in the first study, and 216 Latine caregivers (63% mothers) participated in the second study, which examined the scale’s factor structure. The validation process included parent reports of their child’s numeracy skills (child Mage = 2.93 years, SD = 0.74). Three factors were identified (caregiver–child interactions, caregivers’ math anxiety, and math beliefs).

We investigated: (a) the degree to which academic anxiety contributes to this gap and (b) the role of country-level income inequality in widening this gap. In Study 1, we used PISA 2003 data (250,000+ students from 41 countries) and demonstrated that anxiety accounts for approximately one-fifth of the performance gap between students with less educated parents and those with more educated parents. Unexpectedly, the social class test gap was weaker in more unequal countries than in more equal countries. In Studies 2a and 2b, we used the PISA 2012 and 2015 data (totaling over a million students from 65 countries and 72 countries, respectively) and differentiated the cultural dimension (parental education, cultural capital) and the economic dimension (economic capital) of social class. Regardless of the dimension, anxiety again accounted for between one-tenth and one-fifth of the performance gap between students from lower and higher social classes. Moreover, (a) the culturally based social class achievement gap was weaker in more unequal than in more equal countries, and (b) the economically based social class achievement gap was larger in more unequal than in more equal countries. Unexpectedly, we also find a robust association between national income inequality and academic anxiety across all three studies.

The random intercept cross-lagged panel models were conducted to control for between-person level variance and to explore mutualism of variables on the within-person level. Results indicated the mutualistic coupling of language and externalizing behavioral problems from Grades 3 to 5. When including social skills in the model, only social skills and externalizing behavioral problems formed the mutualism from Grades 3 to 5; language only predicted behavioral problems and social skills in the early elementary stage (Grades 1–3). These results suggest that language and behavioral management early on are important investing skills for the development of language, behavior skills, and social skills. With development, social skills may become more important than general language skills to manage problem behaviors. These findings indicated that interventions targeting behavioral problems may need to adapt their focus as children develop: fostering general language abilities early on but shifting to building social skills in later grades.

Such adaptability implies that schools need to teach key social competences, like communication, collaboration, or problem-solving. In this area, a gender gap has consistently been found, showing that boys display social competences less than girls. A large-scale nationwide multilab longitudinal experiment—the ProFAN project—was conducted in France among more than 10,000 vocational high-school students. Its primary goal was to develop and test an intervention promoting a range of psychological and psychosocial variables in vocational high schools, including social competences. This 2-year long, three-wave field experiment compared the effects of a cooperative learning method—the jigsaw classroom, that entails positive goal and resource interdependence—to two control conditions: one that involves cooperation with resource independence, and the other that remains business-as-usual. This article focuses on the differential development of perceived social competences of adolescent boys and girls over time, comparing the three pedagogical methods. Results of longitudinal multilevel modeling replicate the gender gap in perceived social competences and show that this gap widens with time. However, and most importantly, the analyses revealed that such widening of the gender gap was greater in the two control conditions than in the jigsaw condition, in which the evolution of boys’ and girls’ perceptions of social competences remained similar over time. Contributions to the understanding of the development and teaching of social competences in education settings are discussed.

Regrettably, in practice, parental involvement often contains intrusive, controlling, and discouraging behaviors that can curtail benefits. The present study sought to identify parenting characteristics that may contribute to counterproductive parental homework involvement. Two central mechanisms were examined: parental emotion dysregulation and low parental mentalization. We hypothesized that difficulties regulating negative affect would contribute to negative and hostile parental behavior during homework (but not to controlling behavior), whereas difficulties in parental mentalization would contribute to increased controlling parental practices (but not to parental negativity). The sample included 101 Israeli parents and their elementary school children (M = 8.32, SD = 1.77, 51.5% girls). Parent–child interaction during homework was videotaped at a home visit and subsequently coded to reflect the levels of control and negativity shown by the parent. Parental emotion dysregulation was assessed using a self-report questionnaire (the difficulties in emotion regulation scale), and parental capacity for mentalization was coded from interviews using the reflective functioning manual. Consistent with hypotheses, parental mentalization difficulties were linked to increased parental control, whereas parental emotion dysregulation was linked to parental negativity. These associations persisted even after controlling for children’s externalizing problems and children’s homework performance, as reported by parents. The findings highlight the differential paths by which parents’ diminished emotion regulation and decreased mentalization can foster counterproductive involvement in their children’s homework. We discuss the implications of the findings for parents’ homework involvement and teachers’ support of positive parental involvement.

However, questions remain regarding how neighborhood structural, process, and physical features uniquely predict children’s cognitive skills when measuring neighborhoods more holistically. Exploiting within-child changes in neighborhood conditions over time in a nationally representative sample of children followed from kindergarten through fifth grade (N ≈ 13,550), this study examined unique associations between structural (i.e., concentrated disadvantage), process (i.e., violent crime, learning resources, and aspects of school quality), and physical (i.e., green space and pollution) characteristics of neighborhoods and children’s achievement skills and executive functions. Fixed-effects models demonstrated that increases in neighborhood violent crime and pollution predicted decreases in children’s reading and math skills, while increases in neighborhood school quality, learning resources, and green space predicted increases in reading and math. Children’s executive functions were better when neighborhood pollution was lower and when school quality was better. Our results suggest that improving neighborhood structure, processes, and physical conditions may foster children’s cognitive skill development, especially academic achievement.

The open-ended nature of creativity assessments has made them difficult to score, expensive, often imprecise, and therefore impractical for school- or district-wide use. To address this challenge, we developed and validated the Measure of Original Thinking for Elementary School (MOTES) in five phases, including the development of the item pool and test instructions, expert validation, cognitive pilots, and validation of the automated scoring and latent test structure. MOTES consists of three game-like computerized activities (uses, examples, and sentences subscales), with eight items in each for a total of 24 items. Using large language modeling techniques, MOTES is scored for originality by our open-access artificial intelligence platform with a high level of agreement with independent subjective human ratings across all three subscales at the response level (rs = .79, .91, and .85 for uses, examples, and sentences, respectively). Confirmatory factor analyses showed a good fit with three factors corresponding to each game, subsumed under a higher-order originality factor. Internal consistency reliability was strong for both the subscales (H = 0.82, 0.85, and 0.88 for uses, examples, and sentences, respectively) and the higher-order originality factor (H = 0.89). MOTES scores showed moderate positive correlations with external creative performance indicators as well as academic achievement. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the challenges of assessing creativity in schools and research.

The study utilized event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the neural responses during belief-bias reasoning and explored the extent to which these ERPs explained individual differences in critical thinking. A sample of university students (N = 72) participated in a belief-bias syllogistic reasoning task while their electroencephalographic data were recorded. The task manipulated conflicts between belief and logic within each syllogism. Additionally, participants completed established tests to assess their critical thinking. Our findings revealed that participants with high levels of critical thinking exhibited larger amplitudes of the P600 and late positive component (LPC), indicating enhanced syntactic analysis and relation integration. Moreover, those with high levels of critical thinking displayed smaller N400 amplitudes, suggesting reduced reliance on automatic semantic processing. Notably, participants, especially those with high levels of critical thinking, demonstrated larger late negative component (LNC) amplitudes in response to incongruent syllogisms than to congruent syllogisms, highlighting their heightened capacity to address conflicts between belief and logic. Furthermore, regression analyses indicated that critical thinking relied on both addressing conflicts between belief and logic, as indexed by the LNC, and generating conclusions, as indexed by the P3 components (including both P600 and LPC). These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of critical thinking by shedding light on the neural processes associated with unbiased reasoning and metacognition, as well as offer implications for assessing critical thinking.

However, despite the surge of research on this topic, it remains unclear how specific motivational regulation strategies relate to learners’ academic performance, motivation, and other forms of self-regulation. Based on findings from 55 studies (67 unique samples), we found a range of positive correlations among 10 types and subtypes of motivational regulation strategies and the following variables: academic achievement (rs = .01–.15), motivation (effort, rs = .11–.52; value perceptions, rs = .21–.35; and competence beliefs, rs = .22–.40), and self-regulation (cognitive, rs = .28–.51; behavioral, rs = .10–.33). Moderator results indicated that the magnitudes of associations among motivational regulation strategies and achievement and self-regulation varied by grade level and geographic region. Intercorrelations among motivational regulation strategies indicated wide-ranging degrees of overlap across strategies. Using meta-analytic structural equation modeling, we explored how motivational regulation strategies indirectly related to achievement through motivational beliefs and how self-regulatory factors were precursors to motivational regulation. Our meta-analytic findings shed light upon which motivational regulation strategies might be most adaptive for academic achievement, motivation, and self-regulation, and identified for whom and under what circumstances specific strategies can be most adaptively used.

A registered report investigating education and employment outcomes","Journal of Educational Psychology","","1939-2176","10.1037/edu0000898","","Reading is a key gateway to learning, enabling independent access to a range of educational materials. Thus, reading difficulties leave a child particularly vulnerable to academic problems in later schooling and beyond. However, while there is good awareness of children with word reading difficulties within the education system, much less is known about the children who struggle to comprehend texts despite having adequate word reading skills. In this registered report, we investigated the later education and occupational outcomes of 947 children initially identified as having poor reading comprehension at 8–9 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, compared to peers not identified as having a specific reading difficulty (n = 4,516) and those with word reading weaknesses (n = 1,383). We observed that children with comprehension weaknesses (a) were less likely than typical readers to meet U.K. national educational targets as they progressed through education, with more marked differences for mathematics and science than English; (b) had poorer qualifications at the point of leaving compulsory education, which were comparable to children with word reading weaknesses; and (c) were the group at greatest risk of being out of employment, education and training at age 20. However, there was considerable variability in outcomes, with much of the risk shared with socio-demographic factors. The results address an important gap in knowledge regarding the functional consequences of reading comprehension difficulties in mid-childhood and inform discussions concerning the need for identification and targeted support in classroom settings.

The current study reports on two large-scale randomized trials of combinations of small-group, intensive language-focused instructional component lessons implemented in preschool and kindergarten settings. After screening on two listening comprehension measures, 740 preschool and 870 kindergarten children were randomized to business-as-usual general education or to 18 weeks of instruction that paired two of three possible 9-week component programs. Children were assessed pre- and postinstruction on a battery of proximal, instructionally aligned measures and on standardized language and early literacy measures. Results indicated significant and often sizeable impacts on measures aligned with the content of instruction received. Moderation by order of instructional components and child characteristics provides insight into the overall and specific benefits of early intensive support for language development.

Hélène; Levesque, Kyle","00_Mechanisms in the relation between morphological awareness and the development of reading comprehension","Journal of Educational Psychology","","1939-2176","10.1037/edu0000871","","It is well established that children’s reading comprehension is driven, at least in part, by their awareness of morphemes, or the smallest units of meaning in language. The question of how it does so is largely open; this mechanistic knowledge would specify theories of reading comprehension and guide effective classroom instruction. We report here on a longitudinal study designed to test two candidate mechanisms by which morphological awareness might support the development of reading comprehension: use of morphemes to read words and to understand words, known as morphological decoding and analysis, respectively. We tracked the development of 221 children on key measures from Grades 3 to 5. These three-wave longitudinal data enabled us to test morphological decoding and analysis as mediators connecting morphological awareness to gains in reading comprehension over time. Structural equation modeling showed that morphological awareness contributed to gains in both morphological decoding and analysis. Critically, only morphological analysis mediated the contribution of morphological awareness to gains in reading comprehension between Grades 3 and 5. These findings elaborate predictions of the morphological pathways framework. Specifically, longitudinal modeling shows how morphological awareness supports children’s developing reading comprehension: by enabling the use of morphemes to read and understand words, with effects on the understanding of words supporting children’s growing skill in understanding texts. Evidence supporting these two specific mechanisms inspires the design of targeted teaching on morphemes toward the development of strong reading comprehension.

These programs’ potential can be amplified if children are given the opportunity to meaningfully interact with media characters during their video watching. In this project, we partnered with PBS KIDS to develop interactive science-focused videos in which the main character, powered by artificial intelligence, engaged in dialogic interactions with children by asking them questions and providing responsive feedback. The children who watched the interactive videos performed better on a science posttest than children who watched the broadcast version of the video (without any interaction) or a pseudointeractive version (in which the media character asks children the same questions and gives generic feedback after a fixed amount of time). The artificial intelligence character’s responsiveness positively influenced both the quantity and quality of children’s verbalizations during video watching, compared to the pseudointeractive condition.

Similarly, despite evidence that WPS text-structure intervention (WP.INT) improves WPS, transfer to RC has not been examined. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to assess effects of single-domain text-structure intervention (RC or WPS intervention) for simultaneously improving RC and WPS. Second-grade children with comorbid learning difficulty across RC and WPS were randomly assigned to three conditions: RC.INT, WP.INT, or the standard school program (the control group). Inferential tests for acquisition effects in multilevel models were significant. RC.INT’s effect sizes (ESs) (vs. control) on RC were g = 1.16 and 0.83; WP.INT’s ESs (vs. control) on WPS were g = 1.36 and 1.05. Inferential tests for cross-domain transfer effects in multilevel models were also significant. RC.INT’s ESs (vs. control) on WPS were g = 0.41 and 0.68; WP.INT’s ES (vs. control) on RC were g = 0.91 and 0.54. Children’s text-structure knowledge in passages and word problems mediated acquisition and cross-domain transfer effects in multilevel models.

Here, we tested the effects of deliberately committing and correcting errors during mathematical problem-solving practice on transfer of the learned procedures. In two experiments, university students were instructed on mathematical algorithms (synthetic division and matrix multiplication) and solved practice problems during open-book study. Learners were then tested on flexibly adapting the algorithms to solve novel problems that were structurally more complex or embedded in “real-life” scenarios (i.e., mathematical word problems). Deliberately committing and correcting procedural errors during problem-solving practice yielded better transfer than errorless repeated practice (Experiment 1) or studying incorrect worked examples by finding, explaining, and correcting the errors that one’s peers had made (Experiment 2). Yet, most learners failed to accurately predict or recognize the advantage of deliberate erring even after the test, instead misjudging this technique as less effective. This suggests that experiencing the benefit of deliberate erring is insufficient to dispel learners’ metacognitive illusion that generating errors is not helpful for their learning. Overall, our results point to the critical role of first-hand errors in mathematical learning. Relative to avoiding errors or even studying others’ errors and juxtaposing them with the correct solutions, guiding learners to deliberately commit and correct their own errors after instruction improves mathematical problem solving and transfer.

Less attention has been given to the ways in which cognitive load may interact with the motivational and emotional aspects of learning. The aim of the present study is to examine the extent to which experienced cognitive load directly impacts self-efficacy during course-based instruction, after controlling for learning. In Study 1, results showed that within-time measurements of undergraduate students (n = 390) revealed a strong negative association between reported cognitive load and self-efficacy. However, across-time measurements revealed a positive relationship in which higher load predicted increased self-efficacy at later time points. Study 2 (n = 281) showed similar results using a different measure of cognitive load. Findings point to increases in self-efficacy being a consequence of the cognitive load imposed by instruction, rather than a precursor of the decision to invest mental effort. Furthermore, the differential relationships between cognitive load and self-efficacy within and across time highlight different types of motivational costs associated with invested mental effort as perceived by students. As a result, within and across time impacts of cognitive load offer both an enhanced understanding of cognition–motivation interactions and a potentially new approach to empirically differentiating between and quantifying intrinsic and extraneous load types.

The study was conducted across 30 elementary schools in an urban U.S. school district. The 10-week intervention, comprised of 20 lessons in science and social studies thematic units, was delivered by classroom teachers. The core components were designed to build students’ content and vocabulary knowledge through informational texts and concept mapping and to transfer their schema to argumentative writing and research collaboration. Results show that while the intervention did not significantly improve reading proficiency (effect size [ES] = 0.01 for ELs and ES = −0.02 for EPs) and basic literacy skills (ES = 0.04 for ELs and ES = −0.02 for EPs), it significantly bolstered argumentative writing in science (ES = 0.25 for ELs and ES = 0.24 for EPs) and social studies (ES = 0.42 for ELs and ES = 0.44 for EPs). The treatment effect on reading proficiency among ELs was fully mediated by their improved domain-specific vocabulary knowledge and English oral proficiency. A significant indirect effect on social studies argumentative writing through domain-specific vocabulary knowledge was also evident. These findings corroborate the effectiveness of the content literacy intervention, providing insights into for whom and how the intervention was effective.

To bridge this gap, a comprehensive meta-analysis was carried out, providing a first careful examination of the effect of explicit instruction on SL. Our analysis revealed a significant improvement in SL performance (g = .49) as a result of explicit instruction. Furthermore, we studied various factors that potentially influence the magnitude of the effect size of explicit instruction on SL. Specifically, we showed that explicit instruction in audiovisual compared to single-modality SL produced a more substantial enhancement in SL performance. In addition, the effect of explicit instruction was more pronounced in the linguistic domain compared to the nonlinguistic domain. These findings not only confirm the positive influence of explicit instruction on SL but also shed light on the specific conditions under which explicit instruction is more beneficial. Our findings have important implications for future educational research on developing effective instructional practices that potentially support SL in classrooms.

This necessitates a person-and-context perspective that considers individual, home, and school factors. This study delved into second language learning, an area inherently intertwined with these settings. Utilizing hierarchical linear modeling, the study involved 2,310 fifth-grade English–Chinese bilingual students and 109 teachers across 109 classrooms in 23 Singaporean primary schools where Chinese is taught as a second language. We examined the class compositional effect of Chinese use at home on students’ Chinese language achievement and the cross-level interactions between classroom goal structures (mastery and performance goal structures) and Chinese use at home in predicting Chinese language achievement. Aggregated class-level Chinese use at home exhibited a compositional effect on students’ Chinese language achievement. Additionally, the class-level Chinese use at home strengthened the positive relation between individual students’ home language use and their achievement in Chinese. Moreover, classroom mastery goal structure demonstrated significant moderating effects on the relation between students’ Chinese use at home and Chinese language achievement. While Chinese use at home was positively related to achievement, this relation was weaker in classes with high mastery goal structure and stronger in classes with low mastery goal structure. No main effect or interaction effect concerning classroom performance goal structure was observed. These findings highlight the intricate relation between home language exposure and classroom goal structures. Being surrounded by peers who use the second language often at home may enhance second language achievement. Furthermore, mastery-focused environments may compensate for students with limited second language exposure at home.

Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2011 data set, we compared academic growth trajectories of ever-EBs (including both former and current EBs) and never-EBs and how EB status and family socioeconomic status (SES) intersect to shape children’s trajectories of academic skills development from kindergarten through Grade 5. Compared to never-EB students, ever-EBs performed significantly better in reading, math, and science in kindergarten but grew significantly slower in all three academic areas across primary years. In addition, household income and parental education were differentially associated with academic development, with differences between ever-EB and never-EB students (ever-EBs outpaced never-EBs) narrowing at higher income gradients for reading and math and narrowing at higher levels of parental educational attainment for science. Results suggest that ever-EBs from lower-SES families were more likely to maintain advantages over their never-EB peers from similar SES backgrounds, compared to children from higher-SES families. The current study provided compelling evidence of the different roles of dimensions of SES in shaping academic trajectories in ever-EB and never-EB children.

Despite its relevance, the interplay between, and dynamics of, emotions and their regulation is still little understood, particularly as prior research primarily relied on between-person research. In the present study, we use a situated assessment approach and a novel statistical approach, dynamic network modeling, to simultaneously analyze between-person associations, contemporaneous within-person associations as well as temporal lagged within-person associations and stability of achievement emotions and emotion regulation strategies in multivariate models. We used a total of 6,915 assessments of 201 German undergraduate students on six emotions (joy, pride, hope, satisfaction, anxiety, anger, and boredom) and eight emotion regulation strategies (activation, social support, positive refocusing, rumination, reappraisal, suppression, expression, taking action) during exam preparation in two assessment waves (5 weeks prior, and 1 week before important exams). The results uncovered distinct communities of emotions and emotion regulation strategies, wherein taking action and reappraisal held a particularly central position in explaining their linkages. We found evidence for effects from emotions on the use of emotion regulation strategies, and vice versa, and identified self-enforcing loops and carryover effects. We also observed differences in the stability of the assessed constructs over time, and between the week before the exam and 5 weeks before, that emphasize the consideration of not only person and situation-specific components, but also the respective context at hand, to which end dynamic network analyses emerge as a promising research avenue.

Given the frequent interactions among teachers and students, not only teachers’ emotions but also peers’ emotions may influence students’ learning. This preregistered experimental study investigated how peers’ emotions (either enjoyment, neutral state, or frustration) affect students’ emotion, motivation, and cognition in observational learning of playing a science game. University students (N = 210) watched a video in which a peer model played a game and displayed either enjoyment, a neutral state, or frustration. The data were analyzed by random intercept cross-lagged panel models with Bayesian estimation and generalized order-restricted information criterion approximation. We ran two set of analyses. In Analysis A, we used the peer emotion display that was intended as the condition variable, excluding participants who perceived a different emotion. In Analysis B, we used participants’ perception of the peer emotion as the condition variable. Both Analyses A and B revealed that students exposed to peers’ enjoyment reported higher enjoyment, relaxation, mastery-approach goals, and game performance, and lower frustration, anger, boredom, and mental effort than those exposed to peers’ frustration. We conclude that peers’ emotions affect students’ achievement emotions, mastery-approach goals, mental effort, and game performance differentially. Educators and researchers should attend to emotion transmission among their students and the role of contagion in education.

One resilience-promoting factor in minoritized adolescents’ lives is cultural socialization (i.e., the beliefs, practices, and worldviews that youth receive about their ethnic/racial group’s heritage, history, and values), but the role of cultural socialization in relation to adolescents’ resilience in the face of ethnic/racial discrimination is sporadic with extant studies documenting mixed results. Prior studies are likely limited by their focus on cultural socialization from parents relative to school adults and the larger school context. Following ethnic/racial discrimination, school-based cultural socialization may reduce youth’s anticipation of discrimination, trust in others from different ethnic/racial groups, and rejection sensitivity. To test our theories, the present study used two daily diaries: Study 1 followed 134 African American adolescents over a 14-day period (N diaries = 1,494), and Study 2 followed 159 Asian American and Latinx adolescents over a 30-day period (N diaries = 3,458). In both studies, on days when ethnic/racial discrimination occurred, adolescents reported greater negative affect. This daily effect of ethnic–racial discrimination on negative affect was exacerbated on days when adolescents received less school-based cultural socialization but weaker on days when adolescents received more school-based cultural socialization. The present studies underscore how school adults foster youth’s resilience in the context of ethnic/racial adversity.

Though psychological distress has been associated with worse educational outcomes, less is known about the mechanisms that may influence this association. This study used nationally representative cross-sectional data from the National Survey of American Life-Adolescent (2001–2004) to explore how developmental assets (i.e., self-esteem, mastery, school bonding, educational aspirations, and educational expectations) mediate associations between psychological distress (i.e., perceived stress, depressive symptoms) and educational outcomes (i.e., grades, grade repetition, suspensions, and expulsions) among 1,170 Black adolescents ages 13–17 (52% female; Mage = 15). The study found that educational expectations were a statistically significant mediator; lower psychological distress was associated with greater expectations which, in turn, was linked to better grades, lower grade repetition, and fewer expulsions. Additionally, school bonding was a statistically significant mediator such that lower perceived stress and depressive symptoms were associated with better school bonding. In turn, school bonding was associated with higher grades and fewer school expulsions. Self-esteem also significantly mediated the association between psychological distress and grade repetition. Study findings can contribute to precision in identifying culturally relevant targets of interventions among Black adolescents and help to address racial disparities in adolescent educational outcomes.

Unfortunately, approximately 33% of students fail to master this essential skill in elementary grades. Students attending high-poverty schools are at a bigger disadvantage due to high teacher turnover and lack of high-quality instruction. Recent efficacy studies with upper elementary-grade students attending rural and suburban schools have revealed that the text structure strategy focused on generating main ideas and summarization and delivered by a web-based intelligent tutor for structure strategy (ITSS) had a positive impact on reading comprehension measured by standardized and researcher-designed measures. The current study focused on replicating these findings with fifth-grade students attending high-poverty schools. A cluster randomized controlled trial with 33 elementary schools was conducted with 2-day teacher practice-based professional development, pretests at the beginning of the academic year, followed by a year-long implementation of the ITSS with coaching and modeling for teachers to provide consistent instruction, and posttests administered at the end of the academic year. Multilevel analysis of data revealed large effects on researcher-designed measures related to writing the main idea and recall (effect sizes ranged from 0.97 to 1.32). A small, yet not statistically significant, effect (effect size = 0.23) was found that favored the intervention classrooms on the standardized Gray silent reading test. These results replicate findings from previous studies on the ITSS. The positive results provide additional evidence of the impact of ITSS on reading comprehension for students attending high-poverty schools who need support the most.

However, most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PD programs have taken place in areas with advanced educational systems. This study aims to fill this research gap by adapting (both educationally and culturally) an evidence-based PD program entitled “Leadership for Learning” in the Chinese context where there is a paucity of effective PD programs. Ninety-five classrooms, 202 teachers, and 547 children (3–5 years old) from 24 kindergartens (12 control, 12 intervention) participated in this RCT program which was designed to improve teachers’ teaching quality and child development. The results of the multilevel modeling indicated that the intervention was positively predictive of classroom quality and child developmental outcomes in literacy and executive function skills. As one of the first studies exploring PD effectiveness in China, this study has several meaningful implications for PD intervention as well as cross-cultural research.

Nevertheless, this understanding is somewhat limited to “what works” assessments, leaving aside fundamental questions on relevant underlying mechanisms that make an intervention effective under specific circumstances, for some groups, or even at certain times. Using data from the cluster randomized controlled trial of the Good Behavior Game in England, involving 3,084 children in 77 schools, we showcase the latent adherence growth curve model, a multilevel structural equation modeling approach that takes account simultaneously of intervention compliance, subgroup moderator effects, change over time, and higher-level data structures. This statistical framework allowed a more nuanced view of the effects of the Good Behavior Game on the long-term developmental trajectories of disruptive behavior among male and female students. Our approach enabled us to ascertain the effect of child- and school-level covariates on intervention compliance and change in disruptive behavior over time, as well as the effects of both compliance and noncompliance on outcomes. In doing so, we found evidence of positive effects (reduction of disruptive behavior) on female compliers, but also iatrogenic effects among male noncompliers (increased disruptive behavior). We discuss the implications of our approach and findings for further research and practice.

However, existing longitudinal studies have often examined only a limited number of predictors at one time, leaving gaps in our knowledge about how these predictors collectively contribute to achievement beyond prior performance and how their impact evolves during students’ development. To address this, we employed machine learning to analyze longitudinal survey data from 3,425 German secondary school students spanning 5 to 9 years. Our objectives were twofold: to model and compare the predictive capabilities of 105 predictors on math achievement and to track changes in their importance over time. We first predicted standardized math achievement scores in Years 6–9 using the variables assessed in the previous year (“next year prediction”). Second, we examined the utility of the variables assessed in Year 5 at predicting future math achievement at varying time lags (1–4 years ahead)—“varying lag prediction.” In the next year prediction analysis, prior math achievement was the strongest predictor, gaining importance over time. In the varying lag prediction analysis, the predictive power of Year 5 math achievement waned with longer time lags. In both analyses, additional predictors, including intelligence quotient, grades, motivation and emotion, cognitive strategies, classroom/home environments, and demographics (including socioeconomic status), exhibited relatively smaller yet consistent contributions, underscoring their distinct roles in predicting math achievement over time. The findings have implications for both future research and educational practices, which are discussed in detail.

Reys et al., 1999; Yang, 2005). Although national standards and policy documents (e.g., CCSS, 2010; NCTM, 2000, 2014) emphasize the importance of number sense, limited research exists on the association between students’ mature number sense and other important psychological constructs in mathematics education, such as grade-level mathematics achievement. The present study addressed this gap through a longitudinal design, advancing fundamental knowledge of number sense as a construct. At the start of the school year, middle school students (N = 129 at Time Point 1) completed measures of mature number sense and several related constructs, including grade-level mathematics achievement, executive functioning, and fraction and decimal computation. Students returned in the spring (N = 115 at Time Point 2) to complete an end-of-year mathematics achievement assessment as a measure of grade-level content learned during the year. We found mature number sense to be measurably distinct from related constructs and uniquely predictive of students’ grade-level mathematics achievement at the end of the school year, controlling for their beginning-of-year mathematics achievement.

However, the available evidence is almost exclusively correlational, the results are inconsistent, and it is thus unclear how ability grouping may influence students’ academic self-concept. This study applies causal inference methods to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of math ability grouping on students’ math self-concept. Using a quasi-experimental design and following students who transitioned from elementary school (Grade 6) to middle school (Grade 7) with or without ability grouping (N = 1,660, 90% White, 53% female), we investigated whether between-class math ability grouping impacts seventh graders’ formation of their math self-concept through comparative processes (social and dimensional comparisons) and objective performance information. Through propensity score weighting and average marginal effect estimation, we found that high-grouped students reported lower math self-concepts than high-achieving ungrouped students, and low-grouped students reported higher math self-concepts than low-achieving ungrouped students at the end of Grade 7. Average-achieving students attending schools with a between-class grouping policy showed stronger dimensional comparison effects than their ungrouped counterparts. The effects of prior math performance on math self-concept were nonsignificant for high- and low-achieving students, regardless of their grouping status. These findings advance our understanding of how pervasive school practices, such as ability grouping, shape students’ self-relevant motivational beliefs.

Associations between SS schooling and gender cognitions remain especially unclear. We compared gender cognitions in students from SS versus CE high schools. A longitudinal design addressed long-term reciprocal effects, and propensity score matching addressed preexisting (confounding) differences between SS and CE students. During the final year of high school (N = 667) and again following graduation (N = 463), students completed measures of gender salience, gender stereotypes, felt pressure for gender conformity, and exposure to gender equality. Before graduation, SS students were more gender salient about self, reported more exposure to gender equality, and had less pressure for gender conformity. The magnitudes of these SS–CE differences were small but did not change significantly over time. However, gender salience about self did not predict or mediate other gender cognitions as often hypothesized, and there were no differences in gender salience about others or in gender stereotypes. We conclude that SS schooling is related to some gender-related cognitions both prior to and following high school graduation. However, findings are neither consistently supportive nor critical of either type of schooling. SS schooling was positively related to students’ attention to their own gender, but how this attention relates to other gender cognitions may vary across individuals in ways that need further research. Our design innovations and inclusion of debated yet understudied outcomes contribute to a fuller evaluation of SS versus CE schooling by examining long-term development and by expanding the outcomes evaluated.

Yet, much research has shown that learners frequently fail to access and use applicable stored knowledge when the circumstances at retrieval differ from those at encoding. Recent laboratory studies have revealed that encoding instances of a concept as members of a relational category considerably attenuates such failures of access. In the present work, we evaluate the efficacy of one such technique (category construction) applied in conjunction with direct instruction in the authentic educational setting of middle-school classrooms. Across two experiments, category construction is evaluated relative to a standard classroom practice of a worksheet with comprehension questions in order to assess how well each promotes mastery and transfer of a target concept. In addition, potential supports to improve learning outcomes are assessed: practice with category construction (Experiment 1) and partial precompletion of the category construction task (Experiment 2). Overall, we find favorable evidence that category construction leads to greater sensitivity to the underlying conceptual structure of targeted concepts and delivers transfer advantages over a worksheet control.

A total of 433 children (intervention group) received four basic curriculum units on physics from their elementary school teachers. The units dealt with floating and sinking, air and atmospheric pressure, the stability of bridges, and sound and the spreading of sound. These children entered 60 newly composed classes in early secondary school that completed an advanced curriculum unit on hydrostatic pressure and buoyancy force with their secondary school teachers. A total of 942 students (control group) in these classes had not received the four basic physics curriculum units.

Students in the intervention group showed similar learning gains as those in the control group, but when controlling for pretest performance, they achieved higher learning outcomes. Regression analyses within the intervention group revealed that this advantage resulted from the content-specific transfer of conceptual knowledge from topically related basic curriculum units.

We aim to understand how these tasks are processed and why they are associated with reading skills. We analyzed responses by 298 Greek children in Grades 1, 3, and 5 to serial and discrete naming of digits, dice, objects, number words, and words. We measured the durations of silent and speech intervals in each task and grade and tested predictions about their relations based on a hypothesis of two overlapping processing stages. We found that articulation times were longer in the serial tasks, modulated by task demands. Total times were faster for serial than for discrete tasks, and their differences (serial advantage) were increasingly associated with the duration of speech intervals, consistent with efficient scheduling. Serial naming rate approached or exceeded the limits imposed by processing time, consistent with increasing processing overlap. These patterns were primarily observed for digits, number words, and—to some extent—dice, after Grade 1. Object naming seemed to pose different cognitive demands, stably across grades. Word reading exhibited the greatest differences between grades, consistent with rapid development of automaticity. We interpret the findings within a cascaded processing framework, in which performance is determined by the efficiency of cognitive scheduling of successive operations, constrained by susceptibility to interference from adjacent items. We propose that reading fluency is predicted by serial naming because it is also governed by the same scheduling constraints.
