In sum, the author believes psychopathology is amid a major paradigm shift. Some of the associated changes are quite visible, as they relate to moving away from traditional diagnostic nosologies toward more scientifically tractable models. However, to be successful in the next era we need to develop models that are transdiagnostic, multilevel, temporally informed, and for everyone. JPCS has long been a leader in publishing this work, and he intends to ensure it continues in its role as a forward-thinking and rigorous journal devoted to understanding psychopathology.

The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a framework that summarizes the substantial and growing body of quantitative evidence on the structure of psychopathology. To achieve its aims, HiTOP must incorporate emerging research in a systematic, ongoing fashion. In this article, we describe the historical context and grounding of the principles and procedures for revising the HiTOP framework. Informed by strengths and shortcomings of previous classification systems, the proposed revisions protocol is a formalized system focused around three pillars: (a) prioritizing systematic evaluation of quantitative evidence by a set of transparent criteria and processes, (b) balancing stability with flexibility, and (c) promoting inclusion over gatekeeping in all aspects of the process. We detail how the revisions protocol will be applied in practice, including the scientific and administrative aspects of the process. Additionally, we describe areas of the HiTOP structure that will be a focus of early revisions and outline challenges for the revisions protocol moving forward. The proposed revisions protocol is designed to ensure that the HiTOP framework reflects the current state of scientific knowledge on the structure of psychopathology and fulfils its potential to advance clinical research and practice.

This systematic review and quantitative synthesis considers reporting of sociodemographic characteristics and sample composition in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology (now the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science) over the past 3 decades. Across k = 1,244 empirical studies, there were high and increasing rates of reporting of participant age/developmental stage and sex/gender, low but increasing reporting of socioeconomic status/income, and moderate and stable reporting of educational attainment. Rates of reporting of sexual orientation remained low and reporting of gender identity was essentially nonexistent. There were low to moderate but increasing rates of reporting of participant race and ethnicity. Approximately three-quarters of participants in studies over the past 3 decades were White, while the proportion of participants who were Asian, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latino was much lower. Approximately two-thirds of participants were female, with this proportion increasing over time. There were also notable differences in the proportion of study participants as a function of race and sex/gender for different forms of psychopathology. Basic science and theoretical psychopathology research must include sociodemographically diverse samples that are representative of and generalizable to the larger human population, while seeking to decrease stigma of psychopathology and increase mental health equity. Recommendations are made to increase sociodemographic diversity in psychopathology research and the scientific review/publication process.

Difficulty with reinforcement learning (RL), the ability to update behavior based on feedback, may inhibit the formation and maintenance of social relationships in SZ. However, impaired RL in SZ has largely been demonstrated via monetary tasks. Thus, it remains unclear whether SZ are similarly impaired in social and monetary RL, or whether social-specific factors may further inhibit their ability to learn from social feedback. Thirty-one individuals with SZ and 31 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a RL paradigm to test hypotheses about social versus monetary RL. SZ exhibited impaired RL compared to HCs in both social and monetary tasks. Further, a Group × Task interaction demonstrated that SZ was more impaired when learning from social than monetary reinforcement, F(1, 59) = 5.99, p = .017. This differential deficit to social RL was not accounted for by reported pleasure from social feedback, which did not differ between groups. Instead, SZ had poorer emotion recognition than HCs, t(1, 60) = 4.80, p < .001, particularly for negative emotions, and controlling for this eliminated the differential social RL impairment. These results suggest the possibility that difficulty recognizing social cues, especially those indicating negative feedback, may relate to a reduced ability to learn from others’ feedback. Thus, future research could elucidate whether targeting these emotion recognition difficulties in treatment could serve as a potential mechanism for improving social functioning in SZ.

Implications for conceptualization of eating disorder psychopathology from a network perspective","Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science","","2769-755X","10.1037/abn0000865","","Item selection is a critical decision in modeling psychological networks. The current preregistered two-study research used random selections of 1,000 symptom networks to examine which eating disorder (ED) and co-occurring symptoms are most central in longitudinal networks among individuals with EDs (N = 71, total observations = 6,060) and tested whether centrality changed based on which items were included in the network. Participants completed 2 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (five surveys/day). In Study 1, we obtained initial strength centrality values by estimating an a priori network using eight items with the highest means. We then estimated 1,000 networks and their centrality from a random selection of unique eight-item symptom combinations. We compared the strength centrality from the a priori network to the distribution of strength centrality estimates from the random-item networks. In Study 2, we repeated this procedure in an independent longitudinal dataset (N = 41, total observations = 4,575) to determine if our results generalized across samples. Shame, guilt, worry, and fear of losing control were consistently central across networks, regardless of items included in the network or sample. Results suggest that these symptoms may be important to the structure of ED psychopathology and have implications for how we understand the structure of ED psychopathology. Existing methods for item inclusion in psychological networks may distort the structure of ED symptom networks by either under- or overestimating strength centrality, or by omitting consistently central symptoms that are nontraditional ED symptoms. Future research should consider including these symptoms in models of ED psychopathology.

Everyday interpersonal emotion regulation in current and remitted major depressive disorder","Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science","","2769-755X","10.1037/abn0000877","","Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) have difficulties regulating emotion on their own. As people also use social resources to regulate emotion (i.e., interpersonal emotion regulation [IER]), we examined whether these difficulties extend to IER in current and remitted MDD compared to those with no psychiatric disorders (i.e., controls). Adults with current MDD (n = 48), remitted MDD (n = 80), and controls (n = 87) assessed via diagnostic interviewing completed 2-week experience sampling, reporting on how frequently (IER frequency), from whom (sharing partners), and why (IER goals) they sought IER; how the sharing partners responded (sharing partner’s extrinsic IER strategies and warmth); and how their feelings about the problem and the sharing partner changed following IER (IER outcomes). Using multilevel modeling, the current-MDD group did not differ from controls in IER frequency and sharing partners, but the current-MDD group demonstrated a more mixed (albeit generally adaptive) profile of received IER strategies and benefited similarly or more from certain IER strategies than the other two groups, suggesting that IER may be a promising avenue for effective emotion regulation in current MDD. The remitted-MDD group sought IER most frequently and demonstrated the most adaptive profile of received IER strategies, and they and the current-MDD group reported seeking more types of IER goals than controls. People with remitted MDD seem highly motivated to pursue IER support and their pursuit takes place in particularly supportive social contexts. Research is needed to examine mechanisms driving these group differences and how IER predicts the course of MDD.

Theoretical models propose that acute dissociation is accompanied by specific behavioral, physiological, and experiential alterations and contributes to unfavorable PTSD symptom course. Yet, empirical evidence is scarce. Here, we explored associations between dissociative and behavioral, physiological, and experiential threat responses as well as effects of dissociative responding on PTSD symptom course. Individuals with PTSD (N = 71) participated in a preregistered script-driven imagery study including exposure to standardized, detail-enriched trauma, and neutral scripts. Stabilometry, eye-tracking, facial electromyography, autonomic psychophysiology, and self-report data were collected. Moreover, PTSD symptoms were assessed before and 3 months after testing. Analyses did not link acute dissociation to bodily and facial immobility or staring in response to trauma scripts. However, dissociation displayed an inverted U-shaped relationship with heart rate and was linked to higher nonspecific skin conductance fluctuation and higher high-frequency heart rate variability in response to trauma scripts. Moreover, acute dissociation was linked to higher self-reported negative affect responses to trauma scripts and displayed a U-shaped relationship with unfavorable PTSD symptom course. While results did not confirm hypothesized behavioral markers of dissociation, they do support defense-cascade model assumptions of an inverted U-shaped relationship between dissociation and psychophysiological arousal resulting from a progression of parasympathetic versus sympathetic dominance with increasing dissociation. On an experiential level, results did not confirm posttraumatic dissociation-induced emotional numbing, questioning theoretical notions. The observed nonlinear associations may help explain the heterogeneity of prior findings and might inform an updated conceptualization of posttraumatic dissociation.

This study used machine learning to test whether neurocognitive variables predicted future manic or anhedonic symptoms in two adolescent samples risk-enriched for lifetime mood disorders (Sample 1, n = 73, ages = 13–25, M [SD] = 19.22 [2.49] years, 68% lifetime mood disorder) or familial mood disorders (Sample 2, n = 154, ages = 13–21, M [SD] = 16.46 [1.95] years, 62% first-degree family history of mood disorder). Participants completed cognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, for behavioral and neural measures of reward processing and executive functioning. Next, participants completed a daily diary procedure for 8–16 weeks. Penalized mixed-effects models identified neurocognitive predictors of future mood symptoms and stress-reactive changes in mood symptoms. Results included the following. In both samples, adolescents showing ventral corticostriatal reward hyposensitivity and lower reward performance reported more severe stress-reactive anhedonia. Poorer executive functioning behavior was associated with heightened anhedonia overall in Sample 1, but lower stress-reactive anhedonia in both samples. In Sample 1, adolescents showing ventral corticostriatal reward hypersensitivity and poorer executive functioning reported more severe stress-reactive manic symptoms. Clustering analyses identified, and replicated, five neurocognitive subgroups. Adolescents characterized by neural or behavioral reward hyposensitivities together with average-to-poor executive functioning reported unipolar symptom profiles. Adolescents showing neural reward hypersensitivity together with poor behavioral executive functioning reported a bipolar symptom profile (Sample 1 only). Together, neurocognitive phenotypes may hold value for predicting symptom expression and profiles of mood pathology.

However, insights into their underlying mechanisms are lacking. Here, we tested if SAUD was associated with alterations in the attentional processing of EFEs. In a preregistered study, 40 patients with SAUD and 40 healthy controls (HCs) had to identify the emotional expression conveyed by faces while having their gaze recorded by an eye-tracker. We assessed indices of initial (first fixation locations) and later (number of fixations and dwell-time) attention with reference to regions of interest corresponding to the eyes, mouth, and nose, which carry key information for EFE recognition. We centrally found that patients had less first fixations to key facial features in general, as well as less fixations and dwell time to the eyes specifically, relative to the rest of the face, compared to controls. These effects were invariant across emotional expressions. Additional exploratory analyses revealed that patients with SAUD had a less structured viewing pattern than controls. These results offer novel, direct, evidence that patients with SAUD’s socioaffective difficulties already emerge at the facial attentional processing stage, along with precisions regarding the nature and generalizability of the effects. Potential implications for the mechanistic conceptualization and treatment of social cognition difficulties in SAUD are discussed.

This finding rests largely on correlational research designs, which rely at best on statistical controls for confounding. Here, we control for unmeasured confounders using a longitudinal study of twins. Method: In a sample of 4,078 American adult twins first assessed decades ago, we used cotwin control mixed effects models to evaluate the effect of lifetime average frequency of cannabis consumption measured on substance use, psychiatric, and psychosocial outcomes. Results: On average, participants had a lifetime cannabis frequency of about one to two times per month, across adolescence and adulthood. As expected, in individual-level analyses, cannabis use was significantly associated with almost all outcomes in the expected directions. However, when comparing each twin to their cotwin, which inherently controls for shared genes and environments, we observed within-pair differences consistent with possible causality in three of the 22 assessed outcomes: cannabis use disorder symptoms (βW-Pooled = .15, SE = .02, p = 1.7 × 10−22), frequency of tobacco use (βW-Pooled = .06, SE = .01, p = 1.2 × 10−5), and illicit drug involvement (βW-Pooled = .06, SE = .02, p = 1.2 × 10−4). Covariate specification curve analyses indicated that within-pair effects on tobacco and illicit drug use, but not cannabis use disorder, attenuated substantially when covarying for lifetime alcohol and tobacco use. Conclusions: The cotwin control results suggest that more frequent cannabis use causes small increases in cannabis use disorder symptoms, approximately 1.3 symptoms when going from a once-a-year use to daily use. For other outcomes, our results are more consistent with familial confounding, at least in this community population of twins.

While the harmful effects of these symptoms are well recognized, their temporal dynamics have not been fully tested. To address this gap, our study investigated bidirectional relationships between anxiety and depression in individuals with BSDs using data from the Prechter Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder, collected over an average of 11 years. We included 651 participants with various BSD subtypes (BD I, BD II, BD not otherwise specified, and schizoaffective bipolar type), with at least 5 years’ data for adequate statistical power in detecting temporal dynamics. Bimonthly measurements of anxiety and depression were analyzed using dynamic structural equation modeling. Beyond assessing autoregressive and cross-lagged effects, this study also investigated whether temporal dynamics differed based on demographic characteristics and the use of psychiatric medication. Our findings revealed that individuals with BSDs experienced significant fluctuations in anxiety and depression over time. In addition, we found significant autoregressive and cross-lagged effects of anxiety and depression. Comparison of the cross-lagged effects demonstrated that anxiety had a greater effect on subsequent depression than vice versa. Age and marital status impacted cross-lagged and autoregressive effects. Specifically, older participants had stronger temporal associations between depression and subsequent anxiety, while widowed participants exhibited a heightened impact of depression on subsequent depression. These results underscore the importance of early identification and integrative interventions aimed at addressing both anxiety and depression to mitigate subsequent symptoms in BSDs.

A family systems perspective","Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science","","2769-755X","10.1037/abn0000883","","Controversy surrounds the reciprocity between adolescent and parental depression. Limited studies rigorously tested the transactional model of depression from a family systems perspective considering the involvement of all family members, particularly in non-Western nations, using advanced modeling approaches that disentangle between- and within-unit (i.e., family) variances (e.g., random intercept cross-lagged panel model [RI-CLPM]). This population-based multi-informant longitudinal study applied RI-CLPM to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the interrelations among adolescent, maternal, and paternal depression in 1,733 Chinese families assessed biannually. Findings from two large independent samples (primary sample [N = 1,733]; replication sample [N = 989]) converged to suggest, in macro timescales: (a) more depressed parents—especially mothers—generally have more depressed adolescents (between-family associations); (b) a family member becoming more depressed than usual co-occurred with other members becoming more depressed than usual in the same wave (within-family cofluctuations), with the mother–adolescent dyads exhibiting greater concordance than the father–adolescent dyads; and (c) a family member becoming more depressed than usual did not prospectively predict other members becoming more depressed than usual (i.e., no within-family reciprocal effects). While patterns of cross-lagged effects were consistently null across contexts, cofluctuations were stronger in rural than urban families and stronger in families with older adolescents. Overall, findings suggest that in macro timescales, the previously identified associations between adolescent and parental depression likely occurred at the trait-like between-family level and state-like within-family cofluctuations.

Despite this operationalization, MDD is highly variable with persons showing greater variation within and across days. Moreover, MDD is highly heterogeneous, varying considerably across people in both function and form. Recent efforts have examined MDD heterogeneity byinvestigating how symptoms influence one another over time across individuals in a system; however, these efforts have assumed that symptom dynamics are static and do not dynamically change over time. Nevertheless, it is possible that individual MDD system dynamics change continuously across time. Participants (N = 105) completed ratings of MDD symptoms three times a day for 90 days, and we conducted time varying vector autoregressive models to investigate the idiographic symptom networks. We then illustrated this finding with a case series of five persons with MDD. Supporting prior research, results indicate there is high heterogeneity across persons as individual network composition is unique from person to person. In addition, for most persons, individual symptom networks change dramatically across the 90 days, as evidenced by 86% of individuals experiencing at least one change in their most influential symptom and the median number of shifts being 3 over the 90 days. Additionally, most individuals had at least one symptom that acted as both the most and least influential symptom at any given point over the 90-day period. Our findings offer further insight into short-term symptom dynamics, suggesting that MDD is heterogeneous both across and within persons over time.

Furthermore, studies of mechanisms have focused exclusively on rumination and proximal minority stressors (e.g., internalized stigma). This limits our understanding of other potential mechanisms, such as decreases in the use of reappraisal and reflection, strategies associated with reducing anxious/depressed affect. Method: We used data from a 30-day ecological momentary assessment study with 429 sexual minority women and gender diverse sexual minorities assigned female at birth to determine whether concurrent and prospective event-level associations between minority stress and anxious/depressed affect were mediated by changes in six emotion regulation strategies, perceived coping efficacy, and proximal stressors. Results: In partially lagged analyses, when individuals experienced enacted or internalized stigma, they reported increased rumination and expressive suppression on the same day, which predicted increases in anxious/depressed affect into the next day. Decreases in reappraisal also mediated partially lagged associations between internalized stigma and anxious/depressed affect. Fully lagged mediation was only demonstrated for rumination as a mechanism linking internalized stigma with anxious/depressed affect. We found concurrent evidence for other mechanisms (i.e., perceived coping efficacy, reflection, internalized stigma, and rejection sensitivity). Conclusions: Results provided support for the roles of rumination and expressive suppression as mechanisms of linking minority stress and anxious/depressed affect. The concurrent evidence for other mechanisms suggests that future research with more temporal resolution is necessary to determine the temporality and directionality of these associations.

Although one is often implied in the other, they are seldom studied together. Assessing their relationship and shared influences may allow for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of dissociative experiences. We aimed to examine their temporal (concurrent or directional) co-occurrence, and to elucidate their etiology, focusing on posttraumatic symptoms (PTS), poor sleep, and their hypothesized joint effect. N = 113 adults oversampled for the existence of trauma exposure history reported PTS and then, for a week, wore an actigraphic sleep monitor, reported subjective sleep quality each morning, and reported state dissociation (depersonalization, derealization, and absorption) and sense of agency four times each day. Data were analyzed using multilevel linear modeling. Higher state dissociation correlated with diminished state sense of agency, but only contemporaneously, not directionally. Both hypothesized etiological factors, namely, PTS (especially complex) and poor sleep (objective and subjective) predicted state dissociation and diminished state sense of agency, but psychological distress seemed to overshadow these main effects. However, robust interactive effects suggested that poor sleep predicted dissociation and disruptions in the sense of agency only among individuals with low PTS. These findings suggest that PTS and poor sleep quality are separate paths to dissociation and impaired sense of agency.

The current study evaluated whether (a) interpersonal difficulties, hopelessness, and affective states are associated with an increased risk of SAs on the same and the next day; (b) these daily states are interconnected differently over time among inpatients who attempt suicide compared to those who do not. In total, 110 psychiatric inpatients who attempted suicide during their stay at a psychiatric hospital self-reported their suicidal ideation, negative affect, positive affect, wish to live, interpersonal needs, and hopelessness each day (3,018 daily reports). Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to examine same-day and next-day predictors of SAs. Multilevel temporal network models assessed interconnectedness between daily predictors and were compared to network models from a matched sample of 110 psychiatric inpatients who did not attempt suicide. In multivariate models, increases in perceived burdensomeness were significantly associated with same-day SAs, whereas increased hopelessness was associated with next-day SAs. Network models for patients who attempted suicide indicated that hopelessness and suicidal ideation were central to change, leading to next-day deteriorations in mental health. In subsequent models, feeling calm and relaxed, and feeling fresh and rested were centrally connected to other variables. The centrality of these metrics tended to be higher than in the network models for patients who did not attempt suicide, suggesting differences in the interplay between risk and protective factors. This study suggests routinely monitoring interpersonal factors and hopelessness may help identify increased short-term risk of SAs among psychiatric inpatients.

Relatively few morphometric brain variables were significantly related to INT or EXT across waves, however, with very small effect sizes when present. Next, we tested the extent to which each morphometric brain variable could account for the associations of sex with INT and EXT psychopathology. We found a total of 26 brain regions that accounted for significant portions of the associations between sex and psychopathology across both waves (almost all related to EXT), although the effects present were very small. The current evidence suggests that in children aged 9–12, multiple whole-brain and regional brain variables appear to statistically account for small portions of the sex-psychopathology links, especially for externalizing.

CHR-P individuals not only have attenuated psychotic symptoms that vary in severity, but also have many comorbid diagnoses and varied clinical outcomes, including disorders with uncertain relations to HiTOP (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder). The present study used self-report and interview data from North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study-3 (710 CHR, 96 controls) to replicate the HiTOP model and test specific hypotheses regarding disorders with uncertain relations to its dimensions. Additionally, the present study examined the HiTOP model in relation to childhood trauma, declines in social functioning, and development of full psychosis. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the HiTOP model’s fit was nearly adequate (e.g., comparative fit index = .89), though several theory-relevant modifications were indicated. Additionally, specific tests were conducted to gain a more fine-grained perspective on how disorders with less clear prior evidence were related to the HiTOP model. Notable findings from these analyses include bipolar spectrum disorders relating to the psychosis super spectrum (i.e., .39 loading), and obsessive-compulsive disorder showing a complex pattern of loadings (e.g., internalizing and psychosis). The final model parsimoniously accounted for childhood trauma (e.g., super spectra rs = .22–.32), associations with current functioning, and predicted future conversion to a psychotic disorder (e.g., super spectra R² = .13). Overall, these results inform the HiTOP model and suggest its promise for CHR-P research.

However, extant research has primarily (a) focused on life stress rather than early maltreatment, (b) ignored the time-frequency components, and (c) has been based on a traditional perspective of diathesis stress. The present study aimed to comprehensively examine whether and how neurophysiological (RewP and its time–frequency decomposition components) and self-reported measures of RR interact with childhood emotional abuse on young adult depressive symptoms. The sample of 192 Chinese university students aged 18–25 (Mage = 21.08 ± 1.91 years; 59.4% girls) completed self-reported questionnaires of emotional abuse, depressive symptoms and RR. The RewP and its time-frequency components delta and theta were elicited via a monetary reward task. The results demonstrated that RewP significantly moderated the association between emotional abuse and young adult depressive symptoms in a differential susceptibility but not diathesis-stress manner. However, gain-related delta, loss-related theta, or self-reported RR did not drive such moderation effects. These findings were robust and survived a series of rigorous sensitivity analyses. The current findings provide preliminary evidence that heightened RewP may function as a plasticity factor moderating the association between early maltreatment exposure and depression, and highlight the effect specific to emotional abuse. However, caution should be paid to the generalizability of these findings in high-risk clinical samples, in light of the current high-functioning sample features and low rates of high symptom and abuse levels.

It is unclear, however, how studies on PTSD risk factors integrate this knowledge into their research. Moreover, the temporal development of women’s higher PTSD risk is unknown. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine how prospective studies on PTSD development (k = 47) consider sex and gender across four domains (samples, terminology, analyses, and reporting). Further, we differentially analyze sex/gender differences within five time intervals from 1 month to 5 years posttrauma. PTSD prevalence (OR = 1.72 [1.27–2.34]) and severity (g = 0.31 [0.09, 0.53]) were increased for women relative to men at 1 month posttrauma already, that is, at the first timepoint of a possible PTSD diagnosis. PTSD severity was elevated for women compared to men across all time intervals, but evidence for increased PTSD prevalence for women relative to men was less stable with longer follow-ups. Despite women’s higher PTSD burdens, they were clearly underrepresented in samples (68.3% male, 31.7% female participants). Only 5.0% of studies explained or described their understanding of sex and gender, and only 2.6% used sex as discovery variable, that is, investigating sex-dependent risk mechanisms. Sex and gender aspects in design, data, and discussion were considered by only one-third of studies each. Trauma research falls short of its potential to adequately consider sex and gender. Sex- and gender-sensitive practices can advance rigor, innovation, and equity in psychopathology research.

As individual factors have demonstrated limited predictive ability, scholars have called for studies that consider the multifaceted relations between myriad variables. One alternative to the typical cause-and-effect approach for investigating various forms of psychopathology is network analysis. However, few studies have applied this method to suicidal outcomes, particularly in the context of a veteran population. Data from 19,234 male veteran suicide decedents (89.1% White; Mage = 57.16, SD = 18.64) acquired from the National Violent Death Reporting System were used to investigate characteristics of veteran suicide decedents who died by self-inflicted gunshot (gun; 66.4%) versus alternative methods (nongun, e.g., poisoning, hanging; 33.5%). Results of the overall moderated network model indicated that veterans in the gun group were more likely to have a physical health problem that contributed to the suicide than veterans in the nongun group. Additionally, results of the moderated network model revealed several pairs of associated circumstances whose relationships were significantly moderated by method of suicide, the three strongest of which included having a physical health problem that contributed to the suicide. Overall, results suggest that public health prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing the overall burden of physical health problems among male veterans may mitigate the risk of firearm suicides.

In contrast to the tight syndromal symptom interconnections of, and inevitable spiral toward death expected for, a terminal diagnosis, results suggest substantial variability within the T-AN group and TD-AN subset, and an overall trend of improvement across physiological and self-report measures. This study thus provides some empirical evidence against the specification of the T-AN diagnosis.

Transition to parenthood is a potentially stressful life event that increases the risks of postpartum depression. We aimed to (a) describe the changes in BA and depressive symptomatology between the prepartum period, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum and (b) evaluate the bidirectionality of the relationship between intraindividual changes in BA and intraindividual changes in depressive symptoms longitudinally. Chilean pregnant women (N = 503) completed a battery of questionnaires when they were between 32 and 37 weeks of gestation and 1, 3, and 6 months after delivery. A repeated measures analysis of variance showed that BA significantly decreased from prepartum to 1 month postpartum. A random intercept cross-lagged panel model supported the bidirectional inverse relationship between intraindividual changes in BA and intraindividual changes in depressive symptoms. The effect sizes of these associations were large (βs ranging from −.141 to −.243) according to Orth et al. (2022)’s recommendations for cross-lagged effect benchmarks. This relationship showed robustness when multigroup random intercept cross-lagged panel models were conducted to adjust for several covariates (i.e., marital status, the type of health insurance, type of delivery, primiparous vs. multiparous participants, and pregnancy or delivery complication or newborn health problem).

Previous research provides limited findings on possible menstrual-cycle-related psychological and psychoendocrinological processes in PMDD. By using ambulatory assessment (AA), we aimed to compare mood and cortisol cyclicity in individuals with PMDD and healthy controls (HC), and to assess effects of habitual and momentary repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and present moment awareness (PMA) on mood and cortisol across the cycle in both groups. Individuals with PMDD and HC (n = 60 each) completed baseline questionnaires on habitual RNT and PMA. Momentary rumination and PMA, positive and negative affect (NA), and saliva-cortisol were assessed over four consecutive days during both the follicular and the late-luteal phase. Individuals with PMDD showed mood cyclicity indicating mood worsening while HC showed cortisol cyclicity indicating decreasing cortisol levels toward the late-luteal phase. In individuals with PMDD, lower habitual RNT and higher habitual PMA predicted better mood only during the follicular phase whereas lower momentary rumination and higher momentary PMA predicted better mood during the late-luteal phase. No effects on cortisol activity were found. In HC, higher habitual PMA predicted lower NA during the late-luteal phase whereas lower momentary rumination and higher momentary PMA predicted stronger cortisol reduction toward the late-luteal phase. While favorable habitual cognitions might not protect individuals with PMDD against premenstrual mood deterioration, respective momentary cognitions may reflect possible protective factors, suggesting an opportunity for microinterventions to directly target late-luteal-phase-specific state processes in affected individuals. The lack of cortisol cyclicity might represent an endocrinological marker for PMDD.

However, prior studies may have used suboptimal operationalizations of neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics and externalizing psychopathology, potentially misestimating relations between these constructs. To address these limitations, in the current study we test different measurement models of these constructs and assess the structural relations between them. Using a population-representative sample of 2,195 twins and siblings from the Georgia Twin Study and data from the National Neighborhood Data Archive and 2000 U.S. Census, we assessed the fit of competing measurement models for family sociodemographic, neighborhood sociodemographic, and neighborhood environment characteristics. In structural models, we regressed a general externalizing dimension on different operationalizations of these variables separately and then simultaneously in a final model. Latent variable operationalizations of family sociodemographic, neighborhood sociodemographic, and neighborhood environment characteristics explained no more variance in broad externalizing psychopathology than other operationalizations. In an omnibus model, family sociodemographic characteristics showed a small association with externalizing psychopathology, while neighborhood sociodemographic and environmental characteristics did not. Family sociodemographic characteristics showed small associations with neighborhood sociodemographic and environmental characteristics, and neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics were moderately associated with neighborhood environment. These findings suggest that family sociodemographic characteristics are more associated with the development of broad externalizing psychopathology in youth than neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics and neighborhood environment.

Internalizing factors based on diagnoses (or symptoms) of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are well established. Studies have also integrated self-reported measures of associated traits (e.g., questionnaires assessing neuroticism, worry, and rumination) onto these factors, despite having not tested the assumption that these measures truly capture the same sets of risk factors. This study examined the overlap among both sets of measures using converging approaches. First, using genomic structural equation modeling, we constructed internalizing factors based on genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of internalizing diagnoses (e.g., MDD) and traits associated with internalizing (neuroticism, loneliness, and reverse-scored subjective well-being). Results indicated the two factors were highly (rg = .79) but not perfectly genetically correlated (rgp rg = .76, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.40, 0.97]) and nonshared environmental influences (re = .80, 95% CI [0.53, 1.0]). Shared environmental influences were estimated near zero for both factors. Our findings are consistent with current frameworks of psychopathology, though they suggest there are some unique genetic influences captured by internalizing diagnosis compared to trait measures, with potentially more nonadditive genetic influences on trait measures.

This risk is especially pronounced among adolescents whose home environment is unsupportive or nonaffirming, as these adolescents may face familial rejection due to their identity. Therefore, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms underlying this risk by probing temporally sensitive associations between negative mood and time spent in potentially hostile home environments. The current study included adolescents (N = 141; 43% SGM; 13–18 years old), oversampled for depression history, who completed clinical interviews assessing lifetime psychiatric history and depression severity as well as self-report measures of social support. Participants also installed an app on their personal smartphones, which assessed their daily mood and geolocation-determined mobility patterns over a 6-month follow-up period. Over the 6-month follow-up period, SGM adolescents reported elevated depression severity and lower daily mood relative to non-SGM youth. Interestingly, SGM adolescents who reported low family support experienced lower daily mood than non-SGM adolescents, particularly on days when they spent more time at home. Current findings reinforce evidence for disparities in depression severity among SGM adolescents and highlight family support as a key factor. Specifically, more time spent in home environments with low family support was associated with worse mood among SGM adolescents. These results underscore the need for clinical interventions to support SGM youth, particularly interventions that focus on familial relationships and social support within the home environment.

The aim of the present study was to experimentally test the effect of fading these behaviors in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), social anxiety disorder, and/or an eating disorder (ED). Ninety-four female participants were randomized to either a 1-month text message-based ARSB fading condition (n = 47) or a self-monitoring control condition (n = 47). Findings demonstrated that individuals in the ARSB fading condition saw significantly greater reductions in postmanipulation appearance concerns, appearance importance, ED symptoms, general anxiety, and depression. ARSB fading also led to lower BDD and social anxiety disorder symptoms, though this was only found among those who met for these respective diagnoses. Furthermore, we found that changes in appearance importance partially mediated the effect of condition on appearance concerns, BDD symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and ED symptoms. Compared to the control, the ARSB fading group also demonstrated less reactivity to an in vivo appearance-related stressor task. This study provides strong evidence for the importance of ARSBs in the maintenance of appearance-related psychopathology among a clinical sample. Findings demonstrate the potential utility of reducing ARSBs as an overarching treatment strategy for appearance-related psychopathology.

The present study examined whether heroin use and POM display differential etiologic overlap with symptoms of conduct disorder (CD), adult antisocial behavior (AAB), and major depressive episodes (MDEs), how aggregating heroin use and POM into a single phenotype may bias results, and explored potential sex differences. Seven thousand one hundred and sixty-four individual twins from the Australian Twin Registry (ATR; 59.81% female; Mage = 30.58 years) reported lifetime heroin use, POM, CD symptoms, AABs, and MDE symptoms within a semi-structured interview. Biometric models decomposed phenotypic variance and covariance into additive genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental effects. The proportion of variance in heroin use attributable to factors shared with CD, AAB, and MDE, respectively, was 41%, 41%, and 0% for men and 26%, 19%, and 42% for women; for POM, the proportions were 33%, 35%, and 20% for men and 15%, 9%, and 13% for women. CD and AAB were more strongly genetically correlated with heroin use among women and with POM among men. MDE was more strongly genetically correlated with POM than with heroin use among men, but more strongly genetically correlated with heroin use than with POM among women. Analyses using an aggregate opioid (mis)use variable were biased toward POM, which was the more prevalent phenotype. Magnitude and source of etiologic influence may differ across forms of opioid (mis)use and sex. Disaggregating heroin use and POM in future opioid research may be warranted.

Limitations with observational studies (e.g., confounding and reverse causation), however, have meant the robustness of these relationships has thus far not been explored. To address this gap, the current study utilized genomic structural equation modeling (genomic SEM) and Mendelian randomization (MR) to perform a genetic mediation analysis between childhood maltreatment, loneliness/isolation, and schizophrenia, using summary statistics from three genome-wide association studies (sample sizes 105,318–487,647). While we observed a putative effect of both childhood maltreatment (inverse variance weighted OR = 3.44 per standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.66–7.13], p OR = 2.98, 95% CI [1.37–6.46], p = .006) on schizophrenia, our hypothesis that loneliness/isolation would mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and schizophrenia was not supported (genomic SEM indirect effect = −0.05, SE = 0.05, p = .255; MR indirect effect = 0.10, SE = 0.11, p = .369). Furthermore, reverse mediation analysis indicated that the effect may be in the opposite direction (genomic SEM indirect effect = 0.11, SE = 0.02, p SE = 0.00, p < .001), accounting for 20.3%–28.9% of the total effect. The current results suggest that intervening in loneliness/isolation in individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment is unlikely to reduce schizophrenia risk. On the contrary, targeting loneliness/isolation in individuals with a genetic predisposition toward schizophrenia may diminish childhood maltreatment risk.

Research has found that misophonia is common in clinical, college, and online samples; yet, fewer studies have examined rates of misophonia in population-based samples. The current study addresses limitations of prior research by investigating misophonia prevalence, phenomenology, and impairment in a large, nationally representative sample of adults in the United States. Probability-based sampling was used to administer a survey to a representative sample of U.S. households. Data were adjusted with poststratification weights to account for potential sampling biases and examined as weighted proportions to estimate the outcomes. The sample included 4,005 participants (51.5% female; 62.5% White). Sensitivity to misophonia sounds was reported by 78.5% of the sample, and 4.6% reported clinical levels of misophonia. Results demonstrated significant demographic differences in misophonia symptom severity. Specifically, significantly higher misophonia symptoms were observed for participants who identified as female, less than 55 years old, less than a high school education, never married, lower income, and those working part time, compared to each of the respective comparison groups. Those with clinically significant misophonia symptoms reported that symptoms often onset in childhood and adolescence, were persistent, and contributed to severe impairment in at least one life domain. These findings provide a prevalence estimate of misophonia in the general population of the United States and inform our understanding of who is affected by misophonia.

Yet, little is known empirically about how challenging it is to learn adaptive mental behaviors. Mental behaviors entail taking mental operations and thus may be more challenging to perform than motor actions; this challenge may enhance or impair learning. In particular, challenge when learning is often desirable because it improves retention. Yet, it is also plausible that the necessity of carrying out mental operations interferes with learning the expected values of mental actions by impeding credit assignment: the process of updating an action’s value after reinforcement. Then, it may be more challenging not only to perform—but also to learn the consequences of—mental (vs. motor) behaviors. We designed a task to assess learning to take adaptive mental versus motor actions via matched probabilistic feedback. In two experiments (N = 300), most participants found it more difficult to learn to select optimal mental (vs. motor) actions, as evident in worse accuracy not only in a learning but also test (retention) phase. Computational modeling traced this impairment to an indicator of worse credit assignment (impaired construction and maintenance of expected values) when learning mental actions, accounting for worse accuracy in the learning and retention phases. The results suggest that people have particular difficulty learning adaptive mental behavior and pave the way for novel interventions to scaffold credit assignment and promote adaptive thinking.

Comprehensive knowledge about these mechanisms is necessary to develop tailored, sex- and gender-sensitive preventive interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined sex-/gender-dependent risk factors, that is, risk factors with sex/gender differences in (a) vulnerability or (b) prevalence/severity, as well as sex-/gender-specific risk factors, that is, and (c) risk factors present in one sex/gender only. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and PSYNDEX for articles published until October 16, 2022. We included prospective studies that assessed risk factors to predict subsequent PTSD symptom severity, as measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD scale. The primary outcomes were sex/gender stratified pooled for sex-/gender-dependent vulnerability and sex-/gender-specific risk factors and pooled odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) for sex-/gender-dependent risk factor prevalence/severity. We screened 17,270 records and included 117 reports from 45 studies (N = 13,752) in the systematic review. Seventeen studies (N = 4,257; 1,827 women, 2,430 men) were included in the meta-analysis. Regarding risk factor vulnerability, analyses revealed no significant sex/gender differences except for acute stress symptoms, with stronger associations for men (b = 0.11, SE = 0.06, p SMD = 0.23–0.56) and more commonly had a history of mental illness (OR = 1.81, 1.27–2.58). Men showed higher trauma load (SMD = −0.15, −0.29 to 0.01). Few women-specific and no men-specific factors were identified. Results suggest that women’s heightened immediate psychological stress response drives sex/gender disparities in PTSD symptom severity. Preventive interventions should thus target women early after trauma.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms commonly co-occur but have rarely been examined together beyond prevalence estimates in the perinatal period. Our study aimed to explore patterns of associations among OCD and PTSD symptoms to elucidate within- and between-person effects and how these effects may change over time. Participants (N = 270) were recruited during pregnancy from an academic medical center affiliated with a midwestern university. PTSD, OCD, and depressive symptoms were assessed at pregnancy, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postpartum. A panel graphical vector autoregression model was used to estimate networks. The temporal network provided information regarding directed predictive effects between symptoms, and hyperarousal, neutralizing, and ordering were the most stable and predictive symptoms across time. The contemporaneous network, which yields undirected partial correlations between symptoms at a given moment, indicated that there were positive associations between intrusions and avoidance, hyperarousal and negative alterations in cognitions and mood, as well as between hyperarousal and dysphoria. This study identified hyperarousal and neutralizing as the PTSD and OCD symptoms with the strongest stability, predictive power, and association with other symptoms. Clinically, this indicates that screening for hyperarousal and neutralizing symptoms may identify individuals who could maximally benefit from treatment in the perinatal period.

Recently, BD has been proposed to be conceptualized as chronic cyclical mood instability, as opposed to the traditional view of alternating discrete episodes with stable periods in-between. Recognizing this mood instability may improve care and call for high-frequency measures coupled with advanced statistical models. To uncover empirically derived mood states, a multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to 4-month ecological momentary assessment data in 20 patients with BD, yielding ∼9,820 assessments in total. Ecological momentary assessment data comprised self-report questionnaires (5 × daily) measuring manic and depressive constructs. Manic and depressive symptoms were also assessed weekly using the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale and the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report. Alignment between HMM-uncovered momentary mood states and weekly questionnaires was assessed with a multilevel linear model. HMM uncovered four mood states: neutral, elevated, mixed, and lowered, which aligned with weekly symptom scores. On average, patients remained < 25 hr in one state. In almost half of the patients, mood instability was observed. Switching between mood states, three patterns were identified: patients switching predominantly between (a) neutral and lowered states, (b) neutral and elevated states, and (c) mixed, elevated, and lowered states. In all, elevated and lowered mood states were interspersed by mixed states. The results indicate that chronic mood instability is a key feature of BD, even in “relatively” euthymic periods. This should be considered in theoretical and clinical conceptualizations of the disorder.

However, while there is good evidence to suggest broad signs of affective dysfunction (e.g., blunting of facial expression) in the critical clinical high-risk (CHR) state, it is not clear whether these signs fit into a broader pattern of decoupling. This is in part due to there being no studies to date with this population that include a dyadic interaction. The current laboratory-based dyadic interaction study examined whether there is decreased coherence in CHR between autonomic physiology, as indexed by heart rate, and facial expressions of emotion, assessed by automated facial expressions analysis. The study included 145 individuals consisting of 34 CHR–partner and 41 control–partner pairs who completed clinical interviews and engaged in three naturalistic 10-min conversations while their physiology and expressions were continuously monitored. Compared to controls, CHR youth showed decreased coherence between heart rate and positive (t = 4.09) and negative (t = −7.90) facial expressions. Across CHR and control youth, greater severity of psychosis risk symptoms was related to lower coherence between heart rate and positive (t = 3.97–11.69) and neutral expressions (t = 0.06–4.98), and a change in the direction of the relationship between heart rate and negative expression intensity (t = 7.88–10.60). These findings provide the first evidence for changes in coherence between physiology and facial expressions of emotion in CHR individuals, with larger changes in coherence relating to greater general psychotic-like symptom severity. This evidence may be leveraged to identify targets for early diagnosis and intervention.

Symptom variability in conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and callous–unemotional (CU) traits designate different subgroups of children with externalizing problems who have specific treatment needs. However, CD, ODD, ADHD, and CU traits are highly comorbid. Studies need to generate insights into shared versus unique risk mechanisms, including through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study, we tested whether symptoms of CD, ODD, ADHD, and CU traits were best represented within a bifactor framework, simultaneously modeling shared (i.e., general externalizing problems) and unique (i.e., symptom-specific) variance, or through a four-correlated factor or second-order factor model. Participants (N = 11,878, age, M = 9 years) were from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. We used questionnaire and functional magnetic resonance imaging data (emotional N-back task) from the baseline assessment. A bifactor model specifying a general externalizing and specific CD, ODD, ADHD, and CU traits factors demonstrated the best fit. The four-correlated and second-order factor models both fit the data well and were retained for analyses. Across models, reduced right amygdala activity to fearful faces was associated with more general externalizing problems and reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity to fearful faces was associated with higher CU traits. ADHD scores were related to greater right nucleus accumbens activation to fearful and happy faces. Results give insights into risk mechanisms underlying comorbidity and heterogeneity within externalizing psychopathology.

Research related to PPU has proliferated in the past two decades, but most prior studies were characterized by several shortcomings (e.g., using homogenous, small samples), resulting in crucial knowledge gaps and a limited understanding concerning empirically based risk factors for PPU. This study aimed to identify the most robust risk factors for PPU using a preregistered study design. Independent laboratories’ 74 preexisting self-report data sets (Nparticipants = 112,397; Ncountries = 16) were combined to identify which factors can best predict PPU using an artificial intelligence-based method (i.e., machine learning). We conducted random forest models on each data set to examine how different sociodemographic, psychological, and other characteristics predict PPU, and combined the results of all data sets using random-effects meta-analysis with meta-analytic moderators (e.g., community vs. treatment-seeking samples). Predictors explained 45.84% of the variance in PPU scores. Out of the 700+ potential predictors, 17 variables emerged as significant predictors across data sets, with the top five being (a) pornography use frequency, (b) emotional avoidance pornography use motivation, (c) stress reduction pornography use motivation, (d) moral incongruence toward pornography use, and (e) sexual shame. This study is the largest and most integrative data analytic effort in the field to date. Findings contribute to a better understanding of PPU’s etiology and may provide deeper insights for developing more efficient, cost-effective, empirically based directions for future research as well as prevention and intervention programs targeting PPU.

Problems with self and identity are distressing, disruptive to everyday functioning, and central to theoretical models of recovery. Yet these problems are sorely understudied, in part due to differences in concepts, theories, and measurement models across disorder-specific literatures. Disorder-specific theories are useful for understanding the etiology of disturbances to self and identity. However, while root causes may vary across disorders, their effects on explicit, conscious, reflective experience share important transdiagnostic parallels. These problems affect the extended sense of self as an individual with memories, a present identity, and future expectancies. By extension, these problems are developmental, reflecting an ever-evolving conception of oneself across the life course. Finally, these problems are contextual and intersubjective, constructed over time through interactions with others in the family, community, and society. A unified transdiagnostic model for reflective self-disturbances should therefore be idiographic and grounded in developmental and personality theory, with a strong emphasis on ecological validity. Narrative identity is emerging as a coherent, cross-cutting framework for understanding problems with self and identity across diagnostic boundaries. Important current research directions include transdiagnostic samples and clinical control groups; more diverse samples; expanding on the latent structure of narrative identity in clinical populations, and developing new assessment techniques to supplement trained raters. These directions will further enhance narrative identity’s utility for idiographic, developmental, and ecologically valid clinical research.

Unfortunately, for most clinical and scientific endeavors, only information about the presence vs. absence of a SA is documented and analyzed. In this Viewpoint, we discuss how such a dichotomous operationalization of SAs obscures important heterogeneity among those who have attempted suicide. There are several facets of SAs, beyond the simple presence vs. absence, that are important to consider because they have implications regarding acute and long-term clinical outcomes. These facets include the level of intent to die, the means used and associated risk for death, the actual medical consequences of the attempt, and the chronicity of the behavior. We discuss how considering these SA facets—in theory testing and refinement, the design, analysis, and interpretation of research findings, and clinical practice—will improve the impact of scientific findings.

However, these claims often rely on correlational evidence, ignoring the confounding effects of developmental, environmental, social, and psychological factors that influence mental health. This oversimplifies the complex etiology of mental health problems. We call for a more nuanced understanding of the role of social media in youth mental health that avoids oversimplification. Additionally, we urge researchers to move beyond vague, narrative-driven verbal theories and encode them into precise, testable causal models. Using simulation techniques and specification curve analyses, we show how misspecified models that ignore these confounding factors can lead to biased conclusions about social media’s adverse effects. This simplistic focus on social media use diverts attention from the broader factors contributing to youth mental health problems, hindering the development of effective interventions and support.

This study investigates if family resilience and neighborhood cohesion jointly moderate the link between latent ACE profiles and mental health among Black girls and boys. This study uses data from the National Survey of Children’s Health, combined across the years 2016 through 2021, and includes a nationally representative sample of 5,493 Black youth (48% female) between the ages of 12 and 17. Two patterns of ACEs were identified using latent class analysis characterized by no-to-minimal ACE exposure and moderate-to-high ACE exposure. Membership in the high-ACEs class increased the risk for internalizing problems among Black boys (b = 0.56, p b = 0.42, p b = 0.70, p b = 0.69, p < .01). Findings suggest that the impact of ACEs on mental health is not uniform across Black boys and girls, and that family and neighborhood-level factors may collectively shape the impact of ACEs on the mental health among Black youth in unique ways.

Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment. Participants (N = 151, 51% male, Mage = 41, 87% White, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4 × daily ecological momentary assessment for up to 3 months.

Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week-, day-, and hour-level models (i.e., past use, future self-efficacy). However, most of the more punctate, time-varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have a greater impact within the next-hour prediction model.

The reflexive responding to emotion (RRE) model of emotion-related impulsivity (Carver et al., 2008) suggests that sensitivities to reward and threat in combination with control over emotion are factors that result in internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. In the current study, we adapt the trait-based RRE model to momentary states by evaluating how within-person fluctuations in affect combine with perceptions of momentary emotional control to predict impulsive, rash action and inaction in daily life. Participants (college students and adults recruited from the community: N = 197) completed 8 days of ecological momentary assessment, where we assessed current affect, perceptions of momentary emotional control (via distress intolerance and willpower), and urges for rash action and inaction (5,353 momentary prompts completed). We also assessed subsequent engagement in rash action and inaction. Using multilevel modeling, we found that when people feel greater positive affect and lower negative affect, they also report greater subjective willpower and lower distress intolerance, replicating past ecological momentary assessment findings. Furthermore, we found that momentary perceptions of momentary emotional control moderated the relationship between (a) affect and urges for rash action and (b) affect and engagement in rash action at follow-up. Findings support a dynamic model of the RRE model, confirming that perceptions of momentary emotional control are relevant for both rash action and inaction, particularly when occurring alongside shifts in affect.

Using machine learning techniques, the current study aimed to validate recent findings proposing a subset of ADHD symptoms that, together, predict ADHD diagnosis, severity, and impairment level better than the full symptom list, while also testing whether the inclusion of the factors listed above could further increase accuracy. Parents of 1,922 children (50.1% male) aged 6–17 years completed rating scales of ADHD, CDS, EF, and impairment. Results suggested nine symptoms as most important in predicting outcomes: (a) has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities; (b) does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish work; (c) avoids tasks (e.g., schoolwork, homework) that require sustained mental effort; (d) is often easily distracted; (e) has difficulty organizing tasks and activities; (f) is often forgetful in daily activities; (g) fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat; (h) interrupts/intrudes on others; and (i) shifts around excessively or feels restless or hemmed in. The abbreviated algorithm achieved accuracy rates that did not significantly differ compared to an algorithm comprising all 18 symptoms in predicting impairment, while also demonstrating excellent discriminative ability in predicting ADHD diagnosis. Adding CDS and EF to the abbreviated algorithm further improved the prediction of global impairment.

Yet, missing data can complicate analysis and interpretation. This study aimed to address whether clinical and study design factors are associated with missing data and whether missingness predicts changes in symptom severity or STB. Adolescents ages 13- to 18 years old (N = 179) reporting depressive, anxiety, and/or substance use disorders were enrolled; 65% reported current suicidal ideation and 29% indicated a past-year attempt. Passively acquired smartphone sensor data (e.g., global positioning system, accelerometer, and keyboard inputs), daily mood surveys, and weekly suicidal ideation surveys were collected during the 6-month study period using the effortless assessment research system smartphone app. First, acquisition of passive smartphone sensor data (with data on ∼80% of days across the whole sample) was strongly associated with survey data acquisition on the same day (∼44% of days). Second, STB and psychiatric symptoms were largely not associated with missing data. Rather, temporal features (e.g., length of time in study, weekends, and summer) explained more missingness of survey and passive smartphone sensor data. Last, within-participant changes in missing data over time neither followed nor predicted subsequent change in suicidal ideation and psychiatric symptoms. Findings indicate that considering technical and study design factors impacting missingness is critical and highlight several factors that should be addressed to maximize the validity of clinical interpretations in intensive longitudinal research.

In recent years, the field has prioritized efforts to minimize nonmeaningful heterogeneity and leverage meaningful heterogeneity to improve assessment and diagnostics, inform mechanistic understanding, and facilitate the development of novel treatments. Indeed, exciting developments such as the National Institute for Mental Health Research Domain Criteria and the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology have provided powerful frameworks for facing clinical complexity. While these developments have spurred many advancements, the movement has yet to effectively harness the tremendous potential provided by the brain. Initial work incorporating brain data has focused on validating clinical observations with a biomarker rather than leveraging the brain to provide unique insight into meaningful clinical heterogeneity. To provide future guidance and examples of innovation in the area, we solicited articles from teams seeking to utilize brain research to manage clinical heterogeneity. The search resulted in a diverse illustration of how best to leverage brain data to greater mechanistic understanding and clinical utility. In this introduction, we consider this work and discuss strategies through which brain data can best be used to provide unique insight into clinical heterogeneity. As the science of psychopathology continues to grapple with the promise and costs inherent in utilizing this powerful and complex array of methodologies, it will be important to leverage unique insights from brain science. This special issue provides a useful guide for new and upcoming work and a catalyst for moving the field forward.

However, despite a significant amount of resources invested in this endeavor, few reliable neural correlates of psychopathology have been identified. A common suspect for this lack of success is the significant heterogeneity in symptoms observed in psychiatric disorders. However, this is not the only potential source of heterogeneity, as substantial heterogeneity is also observed in brain structure and function. Thus, for clinical neuroscience to identify reliable neural correlates of psychopathology, it will be necessary to better understand heterogeneity in both psychopathology and the brain. In this commentary, we suggest four shared principles that can help disentangle heterogeneity in both of these domains: (a) the brain and behavior should both be treated as complex measures, (b) a priori assumptions should be viewed with caution unless they can be replicated robustly in individuals, (c) complex models of individual differences require appropriate data to estimate them, and (d) the field would benefit from an increased focus on extensively measuring individuals, such as through the use of personalized models of psychopathology and neuroimaging data. Together, these shared principles can aid in better characterizing—and separating relevant and irrelevant—heterogeneity in measures of psychopathology and neuroimaging.

To understand how anhedonia emerges, changes with time, and relates with other symptoms, there is a need to understand patterns of this symptom’s course reflecting change or stability—and associations with clinical symptoms and neural reward circuitry in adolescents at risk of SMI. In total, 113 adolescents at low or high familial risk of developing SMI completed clinical measures at up to five time points across 2 years and functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning during a guessing reward task at baseline. Growth curve analysis was used to determine the trajectory of anhedonia across 2 years, including different phases (consummatory and anticipatory) and their association with clinical features (risk status, average suicidal ideation, and average depression across time) and neural activation in response to rewards (ventral striatum and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex). The findings revealed anhedonia decreased across 2 years. Furthermore, lower depression severity was associated with decreases in anhedonia across 2 years. There were no interactions between neural reward activation and anhedonia slopes in predicting clinical features. Exploratory analyses examining latent classes revealed three trajectory classes of anhedonia across phases. While preliminary, in the low and decreasing consummatory anhedonia trajectory class, there was a positive association between neural activation of the right ventral striatum in response to rewards and depression. Certain patterns of anhedonia development could confer risk or resilience for specific types of psychopathologies. The results are preliminary but do highlight the complexity and heterogeneity in anhedonia development.

We examined whether prospective relationships between reward functioning are specific to individual disorders or better explained by transdiagnostic dimensions. We found modest results for prospective associations between reward indices and different dimensions of psychopathology, with most significant associations not surviving correction for multiple comparisons. We discuss the benefits and limitations of the modeling approach used to examine dimension-specific associations that future work can build on.

Lower HRV that reflects reduced parasympathetic nervous system activity has been observed in depressive and anxiety disorders. Existing studies predominantly used categorical rather than dimensional approaches, the latter of which better addresses clinical comorbidity and heterogeneity. Moreover, there is little evidence on the role of HRV in longitudinal symptom trajectory in adolescents and young adults. The current study examined the association between HRV and internalizing symptom trajectory using a dimensional approach—the tri-level model of depression and anxiety. Adolescents and young adults (N = 362) were recruited in a 3-year longitudinal study, where they completed electrocardiogram recordings and self-report symptom questionnaires. Multilevel modeling was conducted with high-frequency power bands (HF power) of interbeat intervals at baseline as the predictor, and tri-level symptom factors over 3 years as the outcome. HF power significantly predicted the trajectory of the broad General Distress symptom factor, but not the intermediate Fears or Anhedonia-Apprehension symptom factors. Higher HF power was associated with a decline in General Distress over time. This association was held when neuroticism, other tri-level symptom factors, and demographic variables were covaried. That is, greater parasympathetic nervous system activity at baseline was significantly associated with a greater decline in the broad internalizing symptom factor, but not symptom factors that are more specific to depressive or anxiety disorders. Parasympathetic activity, therefore, may be a transdiagnostic biomarker for internalizing symptoms in adolescents and young adults.

Here, we tested whether machine learning (ML; elastic net regression, gradient boosting machines, support vector regression with linear and radial kernels) could estimate OCPD scores from personality data and whether ML-predicted scores are associated with indices of brain structure (cortical thickness and surface area and subcortical volumes). Among older adults (ns = 898–1,606) who completed multiple OCPD assessments, ML elastic net regression with Revised NEO Personality Inventory personality items as features best predicted Five-Factor Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory—Short Form (FFOCI-SF) scores, root-mean-squared error (RMSE)/SD = 0.66; performance generalized to a sample of college students (n = 175; RMSE/SD = 0.51). Items from all five-factor model personality traits contributed to predicted FFOCI-SF (p-FFOCI-SF) scores; conscientiousness and openness items were the most influential. In college students (n = 1,253), univariate analyses of cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volumes revealed only a positive association between p-FFOCI-SF and right superior frontal gyrus cortical thickness after adjusting for multiple testing (b = 2.21, p = .0014; all other |b|s .009). Multivariate ML models of brain features predicting FFOCI, conscientiousness, and neuroticism performed poorly (RMSE/SDs >1.00). These data reveal that all five-factor model traits contribute to maladaptive OCPD traits and identify greater right superior frontal gyrus cortical thickness as a promising correlate of OCPD for future study. Broadly, this study highlights the utility of ML to estimate unmeasured psychopathology phenotypes in neuroimaging data sets but that our application of ML to neuroimaging may not resolve unreliable associations and small effects characteristic of univariate psychiatric neuroimaging research.

This poses significant challenges to understanding its neurobiological mechanisms and developing effective interventions. Identifying phenotypically more homogeneous subgroups and shifting the focus from average group differences to individuals is a promising approach to addressing heterogeneity. In the present study, we aimed to parse clinical and neuroanatomical heterogeneity in autism by combining clustering of clinical features with normative modeling based on neuroanatomical measures (cortical thickness [CT] and subcortical volume) within the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange data sets (N autism = 861, N nonautistic individuals [N NAI] = 886, age range = 5–64). First, model-based clustering was applied to autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule to identify clinical subgroups of autism (N autism = 499). Next, we ran normative modeling on CT and subcortical parcellations (N autism = 690, N NAI = 744) and examined whether clinical subgrouping resulted in increased neurobiological homogeneity within the subgroups compared to the entire autism group by comparing their spatial overlap of neuroanatomical deviations. We further investigated whether the identified subgroups improved the accuracy of autism classification based on the neuroanatomical deviations using supervised machine learning with cross-validation. Results yielded two clinical subgroups primarily differing in restrictive and repetitive behaviors (RRBs). Both subgroups showed increased homogeneity in localized deviations with the high-RRB subgroup showing increased volume deviations in the cerebellum and the low-RRB subgroup showing decreased CT deviations predominantly in the postcentral gyrus and fusiform cortex. Nevertheless, substantial within-group heterogeneity remained highlighted by the lack of improvement of the classifier’s performance when distinguishing between the subgroups and NAI. Future research should aim to further reduce heterogeneity incorporating additional neuroanatomical clustering in even larger samples. This will eventually pave the way for more tailored behavioral interventions and improving clinical outcomes.

The present study explored the patterns of diagnostic classification errors among disorders with commonly co-occurring features to examine this heterogeneity. Classification analyses were conducted with the University of California, Los Angeles Phenomics Study database using a support-vector classifier to differentiate disorders via whole brain task-based functional connectivity, predicting that model misclassifications would provide insight about brain connectivity characteristics shared across disorders. Whether symptoms and specific brain networks could account for misclassification rates was also explored. The classification model performed better than chance (44% accuracy, p = .01) and revealed that misclassification of schizophrenia (SCZ) as bipolar disorder (BD; 38%) and BD as SCZ (36%) was symmetrical. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was misclassified as BD at the highest rate (46%) and higher than the converse (17%). SCZ and ADHD were misclassified least (15% SCZ as ADHD and 22% ADHD as SCZ). Considerable variance in misclassification of SCZ as BD (R2 = .83) and BD as SCZ (R2 = .71) could be accounted for by symptoms of both SCZ and BD. Permutation testing revealed disorder- and network-specific effects, with certain networks improving classification accuracy and others hindering it for specific disorders. An approach focused on classification errors replicated known disorder overlap, producing errors in the expected configuration. Further, it identified clinical and neural features within and across diagnostic categories that contribute to disorder misclassification and within-disorder heterogeneity. This approach may facilitate neurobiologically informed phenotypic differentiation within diagnostic groups.

Parsing this complexity may be enhanced using “simple” tasks—which we define as those assaying elemental processes that are the building blocks to complexity.

HiTOP provides more promising targets for clinical neuroscience than traditional psychiatric diagnoses and can facilitate cumulative integration of existing research. We systematically reviewed 164 human neuroimaging studies with sample sizes of 194 or greater that have investigated dimensions of psychopathology classified within HiTOP. Replicated results were identified for constructs at five different levels of the hierarchy, including the overarching p-factor, the externalizing superspectrum, the thought disorder and internalizing spectra, the distress subfactor, and the depression symptom dimension. Our review highlights the potential of dimensional clinical neuroscience research and the usefulness of HiTOP while also suggesting limitations of existing work in this relatively young field. We discuss how HiTOP can be integrated synergistically with neuroscience-oriented, transdiagnostic frameworks developed by the National Institutes of Health, including the Research Domain Criteria, Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s Phenotyping Assessment Battery, and how researchers can use HiTOP to accelerate clinical neuroscience research in humans and other species.

The threat conditioning framework is at the vanguard of physiological and neurobiological research into core mechanistic symptoms of anxiety-related psychopathology, providing detailed models of neural circuitry underlying variability in clinically relevant behaviors (e.g., decreased extinction, heightened generalization) and heterogeneity in clinical anxiety presentations. Despite the strengths of this approach in explaining symptom and syndromal heterogeneity, the vast majority of psychopathology-oriented threat conditioning work has been conducted using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic categories, which fail to capture the symptom-level resolution that is afforded by threat conditioning indices. Furthermore, relations between fine-grained neurobehavioral measures of threat conditioning and anxiety traits and symptoms are substantially attenuated by within-category heterogeneity, arbitrary boundaries, and inherent comorbidity in the DSM approach. Conversely, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a promising approach for modeling anxiety symptoms relevant to threat conditioning work and for relating threat conditioning to broader anxiety-related constructs. To date, HiTOP has had a minimal impact on the threat conditioning field. Here, we propose that combining the HiTOP and neurobehavioral threat conditioning approaches is an important next step in studying anxiety-related pathology. We provide a brief review of prominent DSM critiques and how they affect threat conditioning studies and review relevant research and suggest solutions and recommendations that flow from the HiTOP perspective. Our hope is that this effort serves as both an inflection point and practical primer for HiTOP-aligned threat conditioning research that benefits both fields.

Cross-sectional research using categorical diagnoses indicates that P300 is an electrocortical endophenotype indexing genetic vulnerability to externalizing problems. However, current diagnostic systems’ limitations impede a precise understanding of risk. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) overcomes these limitations by delineating reliable dimensions ranging in specificity from broad spectra to narrow syndromes. The current study used a HiTOP-aligned approach to clarify P300’s associations with a higher-order externalizing factor versus syndrome-specific manifestations within externalizing and internalizing spectra during middle and late adolescence. Participants from the Minnesota Twin Family Study’s Enrichment Sample contributed psychophysiological and clinical data at age 14 (N = 930) and follow-up clinical data at age 17 (N = 913). Blunted target P300 at age 14 was selectively associated with externalizing as manifested at age 17 at the superspectrum level (rather than specific externalizing syndromes). Unlike in prior work, target P300 amplitude was positively associated with age 17 depressive symptoms (once controlling for standard stimuli). No association was observed with lifetime symptoms of childhood externalizing or depression evident by age 14. The results indicate that blunted target P300 elucidates specific risk for the development of late-adolescent/young-adult expressions of general externalizing, over and above symptoms evident by middle adolescence. Additionally, the findings speak to the synergistic utility of studying HiTOP-aligned dimensions using multiple measurement modalities to build a more comprehensive understanding of the development of psychopathology.
