Here, we investigated downstream impacts of prediction on memory in two experiments. First, we recorded EEG as participants read strongly and weakly constraining sentences with expected, unexpected but plausible, or semantically anomalous endings (“He made a holster for his gun / father / train”) and were tested on their recognition memory for the sentence endings. Participants showed similar rates of false alarms for predicted but never presented sentence endings whether the prediction violation was plausible or anomalous, suggesting that these arise from pre-activation of the expected words during reading. During sentence reading, especially in strongly constraining sentences, plausible prediction violations elicited an anterior positivity; anomalous endings instead elicited a posterior positivity, whose amplitude was predictive of later memory for those anomalous words. ERP patterns at the time of recognition differentiated plausible and anomalous sentence endings: Words that had been plausible prediction violations elicited enhanced late positive complex amplitudes, suggesting greater episodic recollection, whereas anomalous sentence endings elicited greater N1 amplitudes, suggesting attentional tagging. In a follow-up behavioral study, a separate group of participants read the same sentence stimuli and were tested for sentence-level recall. We found that recall of full sentences was impaired when sentences ended with a prediction violation. Taken together, the results suggest that prediction violations draw attention and affect encoding of the violating word, in a manner that depends on plausibility, and that this, in turn, may impair future memory of the gist of the sentence.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:24:05","2025-07-19 09:53:21","1-23","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\L7TWUGWW\Hubbard和Federmeier - 2024 - The Impact of Linguistic Prediction Violations on Downstream Recognition Memory and Sentence Recall.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, participants underwent two other tasks with the same objects, color naming and semantic judgment, to see if the activation pattern we observe during picture naming is (a) similar to that of a task that requires accessing the color attribute and (b) distinct from that of a task that requires accessing the concept but not its name or color. We used representational similarity analysis to detect brain areas that show similar patterns within the same color category, but show different patterns across the two color categories.

Here, we conducted a combined reanalysis of multiple studies employing this technique in a variety of attentional experiments to, first, establish benchmark effect sizes of attention on amplitude and phase of SSVEPs and, second, harness the power of a large data set to test more specific hypotheses. Data of eight published SSVEP studies were combined, in which human participants (n = 135 in total) attended to flickering random dot stimuli based on their defining features (e.g., location, color, luminance, or orientation) or feature conjunctions. The reanalysis established that, in all the studies, attention reliably enhanced amplitudes, with color-based attention providing the strongest effect. In addition, the latency of SSVEPs elicited by attended stimuli was reduced by ∼4 msec. Next, we investigated the modulation of SSVEP amplitudes in a subset of studies where two different features were attended concurrently. Although most models assume that attentional effects of multiple features are combined additively, our results suggest that neuronal enhancement provided by concurrent attention is better described by multiplicative integration. Finally, we used the combined data set to demonstrate that the increase in trial-averaged SSVEP amplitudes with attention cannot be explained by increased synchronization of single-trial phases. Contrary to the prediction of the phase-locking account, the variance across trials of complex Fourier coefficients increases with attention, which is more consistent with boosting of a largely phase-locked signal embedded in non-phase-locked noise.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:17:41","2025-07-19 09:53:26","46-70","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Attentional Modulation in Early Visual Cortex","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\BBSUVEII\Adamian和Andersen - 2024 - Attentional Modulation in Early Visual Cortex A Focused Reanalysis of Steady-state Visual Evoked Po.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is a vital need to understand the general feasibility and considerations necessary to shift tightly controlled human participant experiments to an online setting. We developed and deployed an online experimental platform modeled after established in-laboratory visuomotor rotation experiments to serve as a case study examining remotely collected data quality for an 80-min experiment. Current online motor learning experiments have thus far not exceeded 60 min, and current online crowdsourced studies have a median duration of approximately 10 min. Thus, the impact of a longer-duration, web-based experiment is unknown. We used our online platform to evaluate perturbation-driven motor adaptation behavior under three rotation sizes (±10°, ±35°, and ±65°) and two sensory uncertainty conditions. We hypothesized that our results would follow predictions by the relevance estimation hypothesis. Remote execution allowed us to double (n = 49) the typical participant population size from similar studies. Subsequently, we performed an in-depth examination of data quality by analyzing single-trial data quality, participant variability, and potential temporal effects across trials. Results replicated in-laboratory findings and provided insight on the effect of induced sensory uncertainty on the relevance estimation hypothesis. Our experiment also highlighted several specific challenges associated with online data collection including potentially smaller effect sizes, higher data variability, and lower recommended experiment duration thresholds. Overall, online paradigms present both opportunities and challenges for future motor learning research.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:24:26","2025-07-19 09:53:29","71-94","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\SBP9DFSZ\Shyr和Joshi - 2024 - A Case Study of the Validity of Web-based Visuomotor Rotation Experiments.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Repeating any component of an event file retrieves all previously bound information, leading to performance costs for partial repetitions measured in so-called binding effects. Although otherwise robust and stable, binding effects are typically completely absent in “localization tasks,” in which participants localize targets with spatially compatible responses. Yet, it is possible to observe binding effects in such when location features have to be translated into response features. We hypothesized that this modulation of binding effects is reflected in task involvement of the dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC). Participants localized targets with either direct (i.e., spatially compatible key) or translated (i.e., diagonally opposite to the spatially compatible key) responses. We measured DLPFC activity with functional near-infrared spectroscopy. On the behavioral level, we observed binding effects in the translated response condition, but not in the direct response condition. Importantly, prefrontal activity was also higher in the translated mapping condition. In addition, we found some evidence for the strength of the difference in binding effects in behavioral data being correlated with the corresponding effects in prefrontal activity. This suggests that activity in the DLPFC reflects the amount of executive control needed for translating location features into responses. More generally, binding effects seem to emerge only when the task at hand involves DLPFC recruitment.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:24:38","2025-07-19 09:53:31","95-106","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Turning the Light Switch on Binding","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\A7SCGIS9\Geissler 等 - 2024 - Turning the Light Switch on Binding Prefrontal Activity for Binding and Retrieval in Action Control.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have shown that statistical learning is accompanied by neural entrainment, in which neural activity temporally aligns with repeating patterns over time. However, it is unclear whether these rhythmic neural dynamics play a functional role in statistical learning or whether they largely reflect the downstream consequences of learning, such as the enhanced perception of learned words in speech. To better understand this issue, we manipulated participants' neural entrainment during statistical learning using continuous rhythmic visual stimulation. Participants were exposed to a speech stream of repeating nonsense words while viewing either (1) a visual stimulus with a “congruent” rhythm that aligned with the word structure, (2) a visual stimulus with an incongruent rhythm, or (3) a static visual stimulus. Statistical learning was subsequently measured using both an explicit and implicit test. Participants in the congruent condition showed a significant increase in neural entrainment over auditory regions at the relevant word frequency, over and above effects of passive volume conduction, indicating that visual stimulation successfully altered neural entrainment within relevant neural substrates. Critically, during the subsequent implicit test, participants in the congruent condition showed an enhanced ability to predict upcoming syllables and stronger neural phase synchronization to component words, suggesting that they had gained greater sensitivity to the statistical structure of the speech stream relative to the incongruent and static groups. This learning benefit could not be attributed to strategic processes, as participants were largely unaware of the contingencies between the visual stimulation and embedded words. These results indicate that manipulating neural entrainment during exposure to regularities influences statistical learning outcomes, suggesting that neural entrainment may functionally contribute to statistical learning. Our findings encourage future studies using non-invasive brain stimulation methods to further understand the role of entrainment in statistical learning.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:24:43","2025-07-19 09:53:34","107-127","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\X3ARAEBC\Batterink 等 - 2024 - Rhythmically Modulating Neural Entrainment during Exposure to Regularities Influences Statistical Le.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To rule out the possibility that this deterioration is because of degraded sound quality, in the present follow-up study, we presented participants with audiovisual (AV) and audio-only (A) speech. We further independently manipulated the trials by adding a face mask and a distractor speaker. Our results clearly show that face masks only affect speech tracking in AV conditions, not in A conditions. This shows that face masks indeed primarily impact speech processing by blocking visual speech and not by acoustic degradation. We can further highlight how the spectrogram, lip movements and lexical units are tracked on a sensor level. We can show visual benefits for tracking the spectrogram especially in the multi-speaker condition. While lip movements only show additional improvement and visual benefit over tracking of the spectrogram in clear speech conditions, lexical units (phonemes and word onsets) do not show visual enhancement at all. We hypothesize that in young normal hearing individuals, information from visual input is less used for specific feature extraction, but acts more as a general resource for guiding attention.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:24:49","2025-07-19 09:53:37","128-142","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\8PUH2ZT2\Haider 等 - 2024 - Neural Speech Tracking Highlights the Importance of Visual Speech in Multi-speaker Situations.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has highlighted the modulation of α power oscillations over the superior parietal cortex during vection, suggesting the occurrence of inhibitory mechanisms in the sensorimotor and vestibular functional networks to resolve the inherent visuo-vestibular conflict. The present study aims to further explore this relationship and investigate whether neuromodulating these waves could causally affect the quality of vection. In a crossover design, 22 healthy volunteers received high amplitude and focused α-tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation) over the superior parietal cortex while experiencing visually induced vection triggered by optokinetic stimulation. The tACS was tuned to each participant's individual α peak frequency, with θ-tACS and sham stimulation serving as controls. Overall, participants experienced better quality vection during α-tACS compared with control θ-tACS and sham stimulations, as quantified by the intensity of vection. The observed neuromodulation supports a causal relationship between parietal α oscillations and visually induced self-motion illusions, with their entrainment triggering overinhibition of the conflict within the sensorimotor and vestibular functional networks. These results confirm the potential of noninvasive brain stimulation for modulating visuo-vestibular conflicts, which could help to enhance the sense of presence in virtual reality environments.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:24:31","2025-07-19 09:53:39","143-154","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\8PTZI28B\Harquel 等 - 2024 - Modulation of Visually Induced Self-motion Illusions by α Transcranial Electric Stimulation over the.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a randomized, double-blind, within-subject design, we analyzed resting-state fMRI data of 66 healthy young participants who were scanned once each after administration of bromocriptine (a dopamine agonist with preferential affinity for D2 receptor), tolcapone (an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase), and placebo, to determine whether dopaminergic stimulation modulated effective functional connectivity between hierarchically organized frontal regions in the left hemisphere. We found that dopaminergic drugs modulated connections from the caudal middle frontal gyrus and the inferior frontal sulcus to both rostral and caudal frontal areas. In dorsal frontal regions, effectivity connectivity strength was increased, whereas in ventral frontal regions, effective connectivity strength was decreased. These findings suggest that connections within frontal cortex are differentially modulated by dopamine, which may bias the influence that frontal regions exert over each other.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:24:21","2025-07-19 09:53:42","155-166","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\SHLDDN7B\Vogelsang 等 - 2024 - Dopamine Modulates Effective Connectivity in Frontal Cortex.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This computational principle results from the highly interdependent relationship of what and when in the environment. Both brain processes and perceptual events display strong temporal variability that is not always modeled; we argue that understanding—and, minimally, modeling—this temporal variability is key for theories of how the brain generates unified and consistent neural representations and that we ignore temporal variability in our analysis practice at the peril of both data interpretation and theory-building.

The protocol involves presenting a sequence of identical repeated events that are eventually broken by a novel “oddball” presentation. Oddball presentations have been linked to increased neural responding and to an exaggeration of perceived duration relative to repeated events. Because the number of repeated events in such protocols is circumscribed, as more repeats are encountered, the conditional probability of a further repeat decreases—whereas the conditional probability of an oddball increases. These facts have not been appreciated in many analyses of oddballs; repeats and oddballs have rather been treated as binary event categories. Here, we show that the human brain is sensitive to conditional event probabilities in an active, visual oddball paradigm. P300 responses (a relatively late component of visually evoked potentials measured with EEG) tended to be greater for less likely oddballs and repeats. By contrast, P1 responses (an earlier component) increased for repeats as a goal-relevant target presentation neared, but this effect occurred even when repeat probabilities were held constant, and oddball P1 responses were invariant. We also found that later, more likely oddballs seemed to last longer, and this effect was largely independent of the number of preceding repeats. These findings speak against a repetition suppression account of the temporal oddball effect. Overall, our data highlight an impact of event probability on later, rather than earlier, electroencephalographic measures previously related to predictive processes—and the importance of considering conditional probabilities in sequential presentation paradigms.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:24:10","2025-07-19 09:53:47","187-199","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\GZET68YX\Saurels 等 - 2024 - Event Probabilities Have a Different Impact on Early and Late Electroencephalographic Measures Regar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we took advantage of the well-known organization of the visual system into retinotopic maps (topographic correspondence between visual and cortical spaces) to assess the spatial organization of induced perceptual cycles. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that they can propagate across the retinotopic space. A disk oscillating in luminance (inducer) at 4, 6, 8, or 10 Hz was presented in the periphery of the visual field to induce perceptual cycles at specific frequencies. EEG recordings verified that the brain responded at the corresponding inducer frequencies and their first harmonics. Perceptual cycles were assessed with a concurrent detection task—target stimuli were displayed at threshold contrast (50% detection) at random times during the inducer. Behavioral results confirmed that perceptual performance was modulated periodically by the inducer at each frequency. We additionally manipulated the distance between the target and the inducer (three possible positions) and showed that the optimal phase, that is, moment of highest target detection, shifted across target distance to the inducer, specifically when its flicker frequency was in the alpha range (8 and 10 Hz). These results demonstrate that induced alpha perceptual cycles travel across the retinotopic space in humans at a propagation speed of 0.3–0.5 m/sec, consistent with the speed of unmyelinated horizontal connections in the visual cortex.","2024-01-01","2025-07-19 09:53:50","2025-09-12 06:23:59","2025-07-19 09:53:50","200-216","","1","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\QXVEPDAX\Fakche和Dugué - 2024 - Perceptual Cycles Travel Across Retinotopic Space.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the complexity of reading comprehension, which incorporates lower-level word reading process and higher-level semantic integration process, our study aims to investigate how age and reading experience influence the neurobiology underpinning these two processes across the lifespan. fMRI data of 158 participants aged from 7 to 77 years were collected during a passive word viewing task and a sentence comprehension task to engage the lower- and higher-level processes, respectively. We found that the neurodevelopment of the lower-level process was primarily influenced by age, showing increased activation and connectivity with age in parieto-occipital and middle/inferior frontal lobes related to morphological-semantic mapping while decreased activation in the temporoparietal regions linked to phonological processing. However, the brain function of the higher-level process was primarily influenced by reading experience, exhibiting a greater reliance on the frontotemporal semantic network with enhanced sentence-level reading performance. Furthermore, reading experience did not significantly affect the brain function of children, but had a positive effect on young adults in the lower-level process and on middle-aged and older adults in the higher-level process. These findings indicate that the brain function for lower- and higher-level processes of reading comprehension is differently affected by maturation and reading experience, and the experience effect is contingent on age regarding the two processes.","2024-02-01","2025-07-19 09:55:53","2025-09-12 07:01:54","2025-07-19 09:55:30","239-260","","2","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\VA3BHXMD\Liu 等 - 2024 - The Effects of Age and Reading Experience on the Lifespan Neurodevelopment for Reading Comprehension.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty-four participants (17 phantasic and 17 aphantasic) were asked to read manual action sentences. By means of TMS, we triggered motor-evoked potentials in the target right index finger. Motor-evoked potential amplitude, a marker of corticospinal excitability, increased during action reading relative to rest for phantasic individuals, but not for aphantasic individuals.

At the neural level, when the bottom–up perceptual input matched the prior prediction induced by the auditory cue, the auditory-thalamic pathway was significantly activated. Moreover, the stronger the auditory-thalamic connectivity, the higher the behavioral benefits of the matched auditory cue. When the bottom–up input violated the prior prediction induced by the auditory cue, the ventral auditory pathway was specifically involved. Moreover, the stronger the ventral auditory-prefrontal connectivity, the larger the behavioral costs caused by the violation of the auditory cue.

To address this research gap, the current study recruited a sample of 156 college students (56 women) who underwent self-report measures of social anxiety, cognitive flexibility, and attention control, followed by a resting-state EEG recording. The results revealed a significant negative predictive effect of social anxiety on attention control, with cognitive flexibility partially mediating this relationship. Furthermore, resting-state theta power emerged as a significant moderator, accentuating the negative impact of social anxiety on cognitive flexibility among individuals with lower theta power. In addition, frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) demonstrated a moderating effect, with lower FAA intensifying the predictive influence of cognitive flexibility on attention control. Taken together, these results suggested that social anxiety can predict attention control either directly or indirectly via the mediating role of cognitive flexibility, and lower theta power and FAA has a risk amplification effect, which provide novel insights into the treatment and prevention of social anxiety and its negative impact on college students.","2024-02-01","2025-07-19 09:55:53","2025-09-14 09:44:52","2025-07-19 09:55:43","327-339","","2","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","How Society Anxiety Influences Attention Control in College Students","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\D9U44U7F\Wang 等 - 2024 - How Society Anxiety Influences Attention Control in College Students The Moderated Mediation Effect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used fMRI to examine how the brain processes the geometric size of indoor scenes when various types of sensory cues are presented individually or together. Specifically, we asked whether the size of space is represented in a modality-specific way or in an integrative way that combines multimodal cues. In a block-design study, images or sounds that depict small- and large-sized indoor spaces were presented. Visual stimuli were real-world pictures of empty spaces that were small or large. Auditory stimuli were sounds convolved with different reverberations. By using a multivoxel pattern classifier, we asked whether the two sizes of space can be classified in visual, auditory, and visual–auditory combined conditions. We identified both sensory-specific and multimodal representations of the size of space. To further investigate the nature of the multimodal region, we specifically examined whether it contained multimodal information in a coexistent or integrated form. We found that angular gyrus and the right medial frontal gyrus had modality-integrated representation, displaying sensitivity to the match in the spatial size information conveyed through image and sound. Background functional connectivity analysis further demonstrated that the connection between sensory-specific regions and modality-integrated regions increases in the multimodal condition compared with single modality conditions. Our results suggest that spatial size perception relies on both sensory-specific and multimodal representations, as well as their interplay during multimodal perception.","2024-02-01","2025-07-19 09:55:53","2025-09-14 09:44:56","2025-07-19 09:55:46","340-361","","2","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\7QN9KAMS\Lee和Park - 2024 - Multi-modal Representation of the Size of Space in the Human Brain.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, information-seeking behaviors are sensitive to different contexts (i.e., threat vs. curiosity), despite having equivalent utility. Furthermore, these search behaviors can be modulated by individuals' life history and personality traits. Yet the emphasis on utilitarian utility has precluded the development of a unified model, which explains when and how individuals actively seek information. To account for this variability and flexibility, we propose a unified information-seeking framework that examines information-seeking through the lens of motivation. This unified model accounts for integration across individuals' internal goal states and the salient features of the environment to influence information-seeking behavior. We propose that information-seeking is determined by motivation for information, invigorated either by instrumental utility or hedonic utility, wherein one's personal or environmental context moderates this relationship. Furthermore, we speculate that the final common denominator in guiding information-seeking is the engagement of different neuromodulatory circuits centered on dopaminergic and noradrenergic tone.

Here, we manipulated the likelihood of switches across blocks of trials in a classic cued task-switching paradigm while participants underwent fMRI. As anticipated, behavioral switch costs decreased as the probability of switching increased, and neural switch costs were observed in lateral and medial frontoparietal cortex. To study moment-by-moment adjustments in cognitive flexibility at the neural level, we first fitted the behavioral RT data with reinforcement learning algorithms and then used the resulting trial-wise prediction error estimate as a regressor in a model-based fMRI analysis. The results revealed that lateral frontal and parietal cortex activity scaled positively with unsigned switch prediction error and that there were no brain regions encoding signed (i.e., switch- or repeat-specific) prediction error.

Representational similarity analysis revealed category-specific patterns in face-and place-sensitive brain regions (fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus) compared with a nonsensitive visual region (pericalcarine cortex). Similarity within face categories and dissimilarity between face and place categories in the parahippocampus was related to better recognition of places from the n-back task. Conversely, in the fusiform, similarity within face categories and their relative dissimilarity from places was associated with better recognition of new faces, but not old faces.

Furthermore, a cross-classification approach revealed the right supramarginal gyrus and occipital place area as regions capable of decoding the general magnitude of the traveled distance. Altogether, our findings suggest the brain uses separate systems for tracking spatial and temporal distances, which are combined together along with dimension-nonspecific estimates.","2024-03-01","2025-07-19 09:57:22","2025-09-14 09:45:11","2025-07-19 09:57:05","447-459","","3","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\ZP46AFDL\Gladhill 等 - 2024 - Separable Representations for Duration and Distance in Virtual Movements.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, there is an ongoing debate as to the functional independence of language processes, notably regarding the syntactic domain. Hence, this study investigated the influence of self-related content on syntactic speech processing. Participants listened to sentences that could contain morphosyntactic anomalies while the masked face identity (self, friend, or unknown faces) was presented for 16 msec preceding the critical word. The language-related ERP components (left anterior negativity [LAN] and P600) appeared for all identity conditions. However, the largest LAN effect followed by a reduced P600 effect was observed for self-faces, whereas a larger LAN with no reduction of the P600 was found for friend faces compared with unknown faces. These data suggest that both early and late syntactic processes can be modulated by self-related content. In addition, alpha power was more suppressed over the left inferior frontal gyrus only when self-faces appeared before the critical word. This may reflect higher semantic demands concomitant to early syntactic operations (around 150–550 msec). Our data also provide further evidence of self-specific response, as reflected by the N250 component. Collectively, our results suggest that identity-related information is rapidly decoded from facial stimuli and may impact core linguistic processes, supporting an interactive view of syntactic processing.

Some neural populations respond to this temporal fine structure, in particular at the fundamental frequency. This frequency-following response to speech consists of both subcortical and cortical contributions and can be measured through EEG as well as through magnetoencephalography (MEG), although both differ in the aspects of neural activity that they capture: EEG is sensitive to both radial and tangential sources as well as to deep sources, whereas MEG is more restrained to the measurement of tangential and superficial neural activity. EEG responses to continuous speech have shown an early subcortical contribution, at a latency of around 9 msec, in agreement with MEG measurements in response to short speech tokens, whereas MEG responses to continuous speech have not yet revealed such an early component. Here, we analyze MEG responses to long segments of continuous speech. We find an early subcortical response at latencies of 4–11 msec, followed by later right-lateralized cortical activities at delays of 20–58 msec as well as potential subcortical activities. Our results show that the early subcortical component of the FFR to continuous speech can be measured from MEG in populations of participants and that its latency agrees with that measured with EEG.

Using fMRI and a priming of pop-out task where participants selected unpredictable, uniquely colored targets among homogeneous distractors via reach or saccade, we show that color priming is driven by shared, effector-independent underlying representations of recent selection history. Consistent with previous work, we found that the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was commonly activated on trials where target colors were switched relative to those where the colors were repeated; however, the dorsal anterior insula exhibited effector-specific activation related to color priming. Via multivoxel cross-classification analyses, we further demonstrate that fine-grained patterns of activity in both IPS and the medial temporal lobe encode information about selection history in an effector-independent manner, such that ROI-specific models trained on activity patterns during reach selection could predict whether a color was repeated or switched on the current trial during saccade selection and vice versa. Remarkably, model generalization performance in IPS and medial temporal lobe also tracked individual differences in behavioral priming sensitivity across both types of action.

Here, we demonstrate that the two subjective states “stimulus present” and “stimulus absent” are represented by two specialized neuron populations in crows, corvid birds. We recorded single-neuron activity from the nidopallium caudolaterale of crows trained to report the presence or absence of images presented near the visual threshold. Because of the task design, neuronal activity tracking the conscious “present” versus “absent” percept was dissociated from that involved in planning a motor response. Distinct neuron populations signaled the subjective percepts of “present” and “absent” by increases in activation. The response selectivity of these two neuron populations was similar in strength and time course. This suggests a balanced code for subjective “presence” versus “absence” experiences, which might be beneficial when both conscious states need to be maintained active in the service of goal-directed behavior.","2024-03-01","2025-07-19 09:57:22","2025-09-14 09:27:20","2025-07-19 09:57:15","508-521","","3","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\IUUQG3CF\Wagener和Nieder - 2024 - Conscious Experience of Stimulus Presence and Absence Is Actively Encoded by Neurons in the Crow Bra.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by associative learning theories, we here investigated whether the mere co-activation of visual stimuli and stimulation of the primary motor cortex using TMS would result in stimulus–response associations that can impact future behavior. During a learning phase, we repeatedly paired the presentation of a specific color (but not other colors) with a TMS pulse over the motor cortex. Next, participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task where they had to categorize simple shapes and we studied whether the shapes' task-irrelevant color (and its potentially associated involuntary motor activity) affected the required motor response. Participants showed more errors on incongruent trials for stimuli that were previously paired with high intensity TMS pulses, but only when tested on the same day. Using a drift diffusion model for conflict tasks, we further demonstrate that this interference occurred early, and gradually increased as a function of associated TMS intensity. Taken together, our findings show that the human brain can learn stimulus–response associations using externally induced motor cortex stimulation.

We compared the activity of four DCNN architectures with EEG recordings obtained from 62 human participants during an object categorization task. Previous physiological studies on object categorization have highlighted the importance of figure-ground segregation—the ability to distinguish objects from their backgrounds. Therefore, we investigated whether figure-ground segregation could explain the predictive power of DCNNs. Using a stimulus set consisting of identical target objects embedded in different backgrounds, we examined the influence of object background versus object category within both EEG and DCNN activity. Crucially, the recombination of naturalistic objects and experimentally controlled backgrounds creates a challenging and naturalistic task, while retaining experimental control. Our results showed that early EEG activity (&lt; 100 msec) and early DCNN layers represent object background rather than object category. We also found that the ability of DCNNs to predict EEG activity is primarily influenced by how both systems process object backgrounds, rather than object categories. We demonstrated the role of figure-ground segregation as a potential prerequisite for recognition of object features, by contrasting the activations of trained and untrained (i.e., random weights) DCNNs. These findings suggest that both human visual cortex and DCNNs prioritize the segregation of object backgrounds and target objects to perform object categorization. Altogether, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying object categorization as we demonstrated that both human visual cortex and DCNNs care deeply about object background.","2024-03-01","2025-07-19 09:57:22","2025-09-14 09:28:31","2025-07-19 09:57:22","551-566","","3","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\SPPW5TAC\Loke 等 - 2024 - Human Visual Cortex and Deep Convolutional Neural Network Care Deeply about Object Background.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first task (two-flash fusion) involved judging one versus two flashes, whereas the second task (apparent motion: AM) involved judging coherent motion versus two stationary flashes. Results indicate two different functional networks underlying two unique aspects of temporal binding. In two-flash fusion trials, involving an integration window of ∼50 msec, evoked responses differed as a function of perceptual interpretation by ∼25 msec after stimuli offset. Multivariate decoding of subjective perception based on prestimulus oscillatory phase was significant for alpha-band activity in the right medial temporal (V5/MT) area, with the strength of prestimulus connectivity between early visual areas and V5/MT being predictive of performance. In contrast, the longer integration window (∼130 msec) for AM showed evoked field differences only ∼250 msec after stimuli offset. Phase decoding of the perceptual outcome in AM trials was significant for theta-band activity in the right intraparietal sulcus. Prestimulus theta-band connectivity between V5/MT and intraparietal sulcus best predicted AM perceptual outcome. For both tasks, phase effects found could not be accounted by concomitant variations in power. These results show a strong relationship between specific spatiotemporal binding windows and specific oscillations, linked to the information flow between different areas of the where and when visual pathways.","2024-04-01","2025-07-19 09:58:55","2025-09-14 09:45:38","2025-07-19 09:58:24","572-589","","4","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\ALBXYRKF\Ronconi 等 - 2024 - Distinct Cortical Networks Subserve Spatio-temporal Sampling in Vision through Different Oscillatory.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of studies have reported evidence that participants with a higher EEG peak alpha frequency are able to detect the presence of two flashes separated by short intervals, whereas those with slower alpha report only one flash. Other studies have not found this correlation. We investigated potential factors that might mask the relationship between individual alpha frequency and visual perception. We recorded resting-state EEG from a large sample of participants (n = 50) and measured the temporal resolution of visual perception with the two-flash fusion task. We found that individual alpha frequency over posterior channels predicted the two-flash fusion threshold, in line with previous studies, but this correlation was significant only when taking into account the steepness of the psychophysical curve of the two-flash task. Participants with a relatively shallow psychophysical curve, likely reflecting high sensory and/or decision noise, failed to show this relationship.

Individual alpha frequency (IAF) is a specific parameter accounting for the mean velocity of the alpha cycling activity, conventionally ranging between ∼7 and ∼13 Hz. One influential hypothesis has proposed a fundamental role of this cycling activity in the segmentation of sensory input and in the regulation of the speed of sensory processing, with faster alpha oscillations resulting in greater temporal resolution and more refined perceptual experience. However, although several recent theoretical and empirical studies would support this account, contradictory evidence suggests caution and more systematic approaches in the assessment and interpretation of this hypothesis. For example, it remains to be explored to what degree IAF shapes perceptual outcomes. In the present study, we investigated whether inter-individual differences in bias-free visual contrast detection threshold in a large sample of individuals in the general population (n = 122) could be explained by inter-individual differences in alpha pace. Our results show that the contrast needed to correctly identify target stimuli (individual perceptual threshold) is associated with alpha peak frequency (not amplitude). Specifically, individuals who require reduced contrast show higher IAF than individuals requiring higher contrasts. This suggests that inter-individual differences in alpha frequency contribute to performance variability in low-level perceptual tasks, supporting the hypothesis that IAF underlies a fundamental temporal sampling mechanism that shapes visual objective performance, with higher frequencies promoting enhanced sensory evidence per time unit.","2024-04-01","2025-07-19 09:58:55","2025-09-14 09:45:47","2025-07-19 09:58:30","602-613","","4","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\LGQABMMP\Tarasi和Romei - 2024 - Individual Alpha Frequency Contributes to the Precision of Human Visual Processing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important testable prediction of this theory is that individuals' peak frequencies of oscillations should correlate with their ability to segregate the appearance of two successive stimuli. An influential study tested this prediction and showed that individual peak frequency of spontaneously occurring alpha (8–12 Hz) correlated with the temporal segregation threshold between two successive flashes of light [Samaha, J., &amp; Postle, B. R. The speed of alpha-band oscillations predicts the temporal resolution of visual perception. Current Biology, 25, 2985–2990, 2015]. However, these findings were recently challenged [Buergers, S., &amp; Noppeney, U. The role of alpha oscillations in temporal binding within and across the senses. Nature Human Behaviour, 6, 732–742, 2022]. To advance our understanding of the link between oscillations and temporal segregation, we devised a novel experimental approach. Rather than relying entirely on spontaneous brain dynamics, we presented a visual grating before the flash stimuli that is known to induce continuous oscillations in the gamma band (45–65 Hz). By manipulating the contrast of the grating, we found that high contrast induces a stronger gamma response and a shorter temporal segregation threshold, compared to low-contrast trials. In addition, we used a novel tool to characterize sustained oscillations and found that, for half of the participants, both the low- and high-contrast gratings were accompanied by a sustained and phase-locked alpha oscillation. These participants tended to have longer temporal segregation thresholds. Our results suggest that visual stimulus drive, reflected by oscillations in specific bands, is related to the temporal resolution of visual perception.","2024-04-01","2025-07-19 09:58:55","2025-09-14 09:45:51","2025-07-19 09:58:33","614-631","","4","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\VCFEFSUG\Karvat 等 - 2024 - Sensory Drive Modifies Brain Dynamics and the Temporal Integration Window.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A simple example is two temporally proximal stimuli fusing into a single percept. It has long been hypothesized that the human alpha rhythm (an 8- to 13-Hz neural oscillation maximal over posterior cortex) is linked to temporal windows, with higher frequencies corresponding to shorter windows and finer-grained temporal resolution. This hypothesis has garnered support from studies demonstrating a correlation between individual differences in alpha-band frequency (IAF) and behavioral measures of temporal processing. However, nonsignificant effects have also been reported. Here, we review and meta-analyze 27 experiments correlating IAF with measures of visual and audiovisual temporal processing. Our results estimate the true correlation in the population to be between .39 and .53, a medium-to-large effect. The effect held when considering visual or audiovisual experiments separately, when examining different IAF estimation protocols (i.e., eyes open and eyes closed), and when using analysis choices that favor a null result. Our review shows that (1) effects have been internally and independently replicated, (2) several positive effects are based on larger sample sizes than the null effects, and (3) many reported null effects are actually in the direction predicted by the hypothesis. A free interactive web app was developed to allow users to replicate our meta-analysis and change or update the study selection at will, making this a “living” meta-analysis (randfxmeta.streamlit.app).

According to the alpha temporal resolution hypothesis, sensory signals arriving within a single alpha cycle are integrated, whereas those in separate cycles are segregated. Consequently, shorter alpha cycles should be associated with smaller temporal binding windows and higher temporal resolution. However, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is contentious, and the neural mechanisms remain unclear. In this review, we first elucidate the alpha temporal resolution hypothesis and the neural circuitries that generate alpha oscillations. We then critically evaluate study designs, experimental paradigms, psychophysics, and neurophysiological analyses that have been employed to investigate the role of alpha frequency in temporal binding. Through the lens of this methodological framework, we then review evidence from between-subject, within-subject, and causal perturbation studies. Our review highlights the inherent interpretational ambiguities posed by previous study designs and experimental paradigms and the extensive variability in analysis choices across studies.

Whereas strong alpha effects were found when perception was more based on endogenous factors, there were null-effects for alpha when perception relied more on objective physical parameters. In this Perspective, I open up a new view on neural alpha activity that resolves some important aspects of this controversy by interpreting alpha not as temporal processing of sensory inputs per se but above all as the observer's internal processing dynamics, their so-called perception sets. Perception sets reflect internally stored knowledge for how to organize and build up perceptual processes. They result from previous sensory experiences, are under top–down control to support goal-directed behavior, and root in pre-established neural networks that communicate through alpha frequency channels. I present three example cases from the recent neuroscience literature that show an influence of alpha-driven perception sets on the observer's visual-temporal resolution, object processing, and the processing of behaviorally relevant image content. Because alpha-driven perception sets can structure perception from its high-level aspects, like categories, down to its basic building blocks, like objects and time samples, they may have a fundamental impact on our conscious experience of the sensory world, including our perception of time itself.","2024-04-01","2025-07-19 09:58:55","2025-09-14 09:36:06","2025-07-19 09:58:50","712-720","","4","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\QQQPFE9L\Wutz - 2024 - Alpha Oscillations Create the Illusion of Time.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we argue that interpreting oscillations as traveling waves is a useful paradigm shift to understand their role in temporal binding and address controversial results. After a brief definition of traveling waves, we propose an original view on temporal integration that considers this new perspective. We first focus on cortical dynamics, then speculate about the role of thalamic nuclei in modulating the waves, and on the possible consequences for rhythmic temporal binding. In conclusion, we highlight the importance of considering oscillations as traveling waves when investigating their role in cognitive functions.","2024-04-01","2025-07-19 09:58:55","2025-09-12 06:31:21","2025-07-19 09:58:53","721-729","","4","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\QTGPR799\Alamia和VanRullen - 2024 - A Traveling Waves Perspective on Temporal Binding.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, participants viewed naturalistic images under task-free settings and self-paced each image's viewing duration while undergoing EEG and pupillometry recordings. Across two independent data sets, we observed large inter- and intra-individual variability in viewing duration. However, beyond an image's presentation order and category, specific image content had no consistent effects on spontaneous viewing duration across participants. Overall, longer viewing durations were associated with sustained enhanced posterior positivity and anterior negativity in the ERPs. Individual-specific variations in the spontaneous viewing duration were consistently correlated with evoked EEG activity amplitudes and pupil size changes. By contrast, presentation order was selectively correlated with baseline alpha power and baseline pupil size. Critically, spontaneous viewing duration was strongly predicted by the temporal stability in neural activity patterns starting as early as 350 msec after image onset, suggesting that early neural stability is a key predictor for sustained perceptual engagement. Interestingly, neither bottom–up nor top–down predictions about image category influenced spontaneous viewing duration.

Twenty-four younger and 25 older participants performed a visual search task with contextual cueing. Contextual information was generated using repeated face configurations alongside random new configurations. We measured RT difference between new and repeated configurations; ERPs to uncover the neural processes underlying contextual cueing for early (N2pc), intermediate (P3b), and late (r-LRP) processes; and multiscale entropy and spectral power density analyses to examine neural dynamics. Both younger and older adults showed similar contextual cueing benefits in their visual search efficiency at the behavioral level. In addition, they showed similar patterns regarding contextual information processing: Repeated face configurations evoked decreased finer timescale entropy (1–20 msec) and higher frequency band power (13–30 Hz) compared with new configurations. However, we detected age-related differences in ERPs: Younger, but not older adults, had larger N2pc and P3b components for repeated compared with new configurations.

Prior work suggests that VWM is spatially organized and relies on spatial attention directed toward locations at which memory items were encoded, even if location is task-irrelevant. Importantly, attention often needs to be dynamically redistributed between locations, for example, in preparation for an upcoming probe. Very little is known about how attentional resources are distributed between multiple locations during a VWM task and even less about the dynamic changes governing such attentional shifts over time. This is largely due to the inability to use behavioral outcomes to reveal fast dynamic changes within trials. We here demonstrated that EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) successfully track the dynamic allocation of spatial attention during a VWM task. Participants were presented with to-be-memorized gratings and distractors at two distinct locations, tagged with flickering discs. This allowed us to dynamically track attention allocated to memory and distractor items via their coupling with space by quantifying the amplitude and coherence of SSVEP responses in the EEG signal to flickering stimuli at the former memory and distractor locations. SSVEP responses did not differ between memory and distractor locations during early maintenance. However, shortly before probe comparison, we observed a decrease in SSVEP coherence over distractor locations indicative of a reallocation of spatial attentional resources. RTs were shorter when preceded by stronger decreases in SSVEP coherence at distractor locations, likely reflecting attentional shifts from the distractor to the probe or memory location. We demonstrate that SSVEPs can inform about dynamic processes in VWM, even if location does not have to be reported by participants. This finding not only supports the notion of a spatially organized VWM but also reveals that SSVEPs betray a dynamic prioritization process of working memory items and locations over time that is directly predictive of memory performance.","2024-05-01","2025-07-19 10:01:49","2025-09-14 09:46:46","2025-07-19 10:01:31","800-814","","5","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\4N59QKQ5\Chota 等 - 2024 - Steady-state Visual Evoked Potentials Reveal Dynamic (Re)allocation of Spatial Attention during Main.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent behavioral evidence suggests that the classic distinction between voluntary (goal-driven) and involuntary (stimulus-driven) influences over attentional allocation also applies to the selection of internal representations held in working memory. In the current EEG study, we set out to investigate the neural dynamics associated with the competition between voluntary and involuntary control over the focus of attention in visual working memory. We show that when voluntary and involuntary factors compete for the internal focus of attention, prioritization of the appropriate item is delayed—as reflected both in delayed gaze biases that track internal selection and in delayed neural beta (15–25 Hz) dynamics that track the planning for the upcoming memory-guided manual action. We further show how this competition is paralleled—possibly resolved—by an increase in frontal midline theta (4–8 Hz) activity that, moreover, predicts the speed of ensuing memory-guided behavior. Finally, because theta increased following retrocues that effectively reduced working-memory load, our data unveil how frontal theta activity during internal attentional focusing tracks demands on cognitive control over and above working-memory load. Together, these data yield new insight into the neural dynamics that govern the focus of attention in visual working memory, and disentangle the contributions of frontal midline theta activity to the processes of control versus retention in working memory.","2024-05-01","2025-07-19 10:01:49","2025-09-14 09:46:50","2025-07-19 10:01:32","815-827","","5","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\UCCN3TNA\Ding 等 - 2024 - Neural Signatures of Competition between Voluntary and Involuntary Influences over the Focus of Atte.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were scanned with event-related fMRI while performing a 2-back working memory task with embedded 3-back lures designed to induce PI. We found that the ability to control interference in working memory was modulated by level of activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left hippocampus, and bilateral caudate nucleus during encoding. These results provide insight to the processes underlying control of PI in working memory and suggest that encoding of temporal context details support subsequent interference control.","2024-05-01","2025-07-19 10:01:49","2025-09-14 09:46:55","2025-07-19 10:01:34","828-835","","5","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\546GEV76\Samrani和Persson - 2024 - Encoding-related Brain Activity Predicts Subsequent Trial-level Control of Proactive Interference in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using behavioral performance, functional, and diffusion imaging techniques, we found that: (1) during language control, the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left caudate nucleus (CN), inferior parietal lobe, precuneus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)/pre-SMA were significantly activated. (2) In the language control model with left dlPFC, dACC/pre-SMA, and left CN as ROIs (selected based on activation results and language control models from previous studies), stimuli first enter dACC/pre-SMA and then to left CN. At the left CN, a bidirectional effective connectivity is formed with left dlPFC. (3) There is a nonlinear relationship between effective connectivity during language control and the structural connectivity of the second language learners' brains. Specifically, the fiber density between dACC/pre-SMA and left dlPFC has a positive influence on the bidirectional effective connectivity between left dlPFC and left CN.

There has not yet been research on the neural correlates of analogical reasoning on syntactic patterns generated by the syntactic rules, a key feature of human language faculty. The present investigation took an initial step to address this paucity. Twenty-four participants, whose brain activity was monitored by fMRI, engaged in first-order and second-order relational judgments of syntactic patterns as well as simple and complex working memory tasks. After scanning, participants rated the difficulty of each step during analogical reasoning; these ratings were related to signal intensities in activated regions of interest using Spearman correlation analyses. After prior research, differences in activation levels during second-order and first-order relational judgments were taken as evidence of analogical reasoning. These analyses showed that analogical reasoning on syntactic patterns recruited brain regions consistent with those supporting visuospatial and semantic analogies, including the anterior and posterior parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, anatomically corresponding to the left rostrolateral pFC and the left dorsolateral pFC. The correlation results further revealed that the posterior middle frontal gyrus might be involved in analogical access and mapping with syntactic patterns. Our study is the first to investigate the process of analogical reasoning on syntactic patterns at the neurobiological level and provide evidence of the specific functional roles of related regions during subprocesses of analogical reasoning.","2024-05-01","2025-07-19 10:01:49","2025-09-14 09:47:04","2025-07-19 10:01:38","854-871","","5","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\5HYTIGY2\Li 等 - 2024 - Neural Correlates of Analogical Reasoning on Syntactic Patterns.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuroimaging studies with face stimuli suggest that repetition suppression (RS) reflects predictive processing at the neural level, as this effect is larger when repetitions are more frequent, that is, more expected. It remains unclear, however, at the temporal level whether and how RS and its modulation by expectation occur in visual word recognition. To address this gap, the present study aimed to investigate the presence and time course of these effects during visual word recognition using EEG. Thirty-six native Cantonese speakers were presented with pairs of Chinese written words and performed a nonlinguistic oddball task. The second word of a pair was either a repetition of the first or a different word (alternation). In repetition blocks, 75% of trials were repetitions and 25% were alternations, whereas the reverse was true in alternation blocks. Topographic analysis of variance of EEG at each time point showed robust RS effects in three time windows (141–227 msec, 242–445 msec, and 467–513 msec) reflecting facilitation of visual word recognition. Importantly, the modulation of RS by expectation was observed at the late rather than early intervals (334–387 msec, 465–550 msec, and 559–632 msec) and more than 100 msec after the first RS effects. In the predictive coding view of RS, only late repetition effects are modulated by expectation, whereas early RS effects may be mediated by lower-level predictions. Taken together, our findings provide the first EEG evidence revealing distinct temporal dynamics of RS effects and repetition probability on RS effects in visual processing of Chinese words.","2024-05-01","2025-07-19 10:01:49","2025-09-14 09:47:08","2025-07-19 10:01:40","872-887","","5","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Expectation Modulates Repetition Suppression at Late But Not Early Stages during Visual Word Recognition","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\8EBXUHWP\Song 等 - 2024 - Expectation Modulates Repetition Suppression at Late But Not Early Stages during Visual Word Recogni.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined whether states of curiosity influence specific ERPs associated with reward processing and whether these ERPs are related with later memory benefits. In an initial screening phase, participants indicated their curiosity and confidence in prior knowledge about answers to various trivia questions. In a subsequent study phase, we targeted different time windows related to reward processing during the presentation of trivia answers containing the reward positivity (RewP; 250–350 msec), the P3 (250–500 msec), and the late-positive-potential (LPP; 600–1000 msec).

Inspired by recent results with hidden-state modeling, we tested the hypothesis that spectral-power volatility is directly associated with problem-solving outcomes. As predicted, volatility was lower during trials solved with insight compared with those solved analytically. Moreover, volatility during prestimulus preparation for problem-solving predicted solving outcomes, including solving success and solving time. These novel findings were replicated in a separate data set from an anagram-solving task, suggesting that less-rapid transitions between neural oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization predict better solving performance and are conducive to solving with insight for these types of problems.

Previous studies proposed that theta-band activity reflects the maintenance of rules associating stimuli to appropriate actions (i.e., the rule set), whereas delta synchrony is specifically associated with the control over the context for when to apply a set of rules (i.e., the rule abstraction). We tested these predictions using EEG and fMRI data collected during the performance of a hierarchical cognitive control task that manipulated the level of abstraction of task rules and their set-size.

In this study, we collected 16 self-reported scores of anxiety dimensions and obtained spatial features of EEG recordings from 171 individuals. We then used machine learning to (1) identify symptoms that are central for elevated ERN/Pe and (2) estimate the generalizability of traditional statistical approaches. ERN was associated with rumination, threat overestimation, and inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty. Pe was associated with rumination, prospective intolerance of uncertainty, and behavioral inhibition. Our findings emphasize that not only the amplitude of ERN but also other sources of brain signal variance encode information relevant to individual differences in error processing.

Both studies showed stronger automatic change detection indexed by MMN in lower SES individuals, regardless of the unattended sound's feature, attended emotional content, or study type. Moreover, we observed a larger MMN in lower-SES participants, although they did not show differences in brain and behavior responses to the attended task. Lower-SES people also did not involuntarily orient more attention to sound changes (i.e., deviant stimuli), as indexed by the P3a.

Pupillometry and EEG were simultaneously recorded, and subsequent sentence recognition and word recall were measured. Like young adults in prior work, we found that noise led to increases in pupil size, delayed and reduced ERP responses, and decreased recall for unexpected words. However, in contrast to prior work in young adults where a larger pupillary response predicted a recovery of the N400 at the cost of poorer memory performance in noise, older adults did not show an associated recovery of the N400 despite decreased memory performance. Instead, we found that in quiet, increases in pupil size were associated with delays in N400 onset latencies and increased recognition memory performance.

Although functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the involvement of the default mode network (DMN) in self-representation, little is known about how the DMN subsystems contribute differentially to IS-related and SS-related AMs. To elucidate this issue, we used fMRI to scan healthy young adults during the recollection of AMs. We performed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and assessed functional connectivity in the DMN subsystems: the midline core, medial temporal lobe (MTL), and dorsomedial pFC (dmPFC) subsystems. The study yielded two main sets of findings. First, MVPA revealed that all DMN subsystems showed significant classification accuracy between IS-related and nonsocial-self-related AMs, and IS-related functional connectivity of the midline core regions with the retrosplenial cortex of the MTL subsystem and the dmPFC of the dmPFC subsystem was significant. Second, MVPA significantly distinguished between SS-related and nonsocial-self-related AMs in the midline core and dmPFC subsystems but not in the MTL subsystem, and SS-related functional connectivity with the midline core regions was significant in the temporal pole and TPJ of the dmPFC subsystem. Thus, dissociable neural mechanisms in the DMN could contribute to different aspects of self-representation in social AMs.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:21:23","2025-07-19 10:03:36","1021-1036","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\7T7DV7XG\Katsumi 等 - 2024 - Roles of the Default Mode Network in Different Aspects of Self-representation When Remembering Socia.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This issue was addressed in an EEG study manipulating the context of a repeated unpredictable word (repetition of the complete sentence or repetition of the word in a new sentence context) and sentence constraint. For the manipulation of sentence constraint, unexpected words were presented either in high-constraint (eliciting a precise prediction) or low-constraint sentences (not eliciting any specific prediction). Repetition-induced reduction of N400 amplitudes and of power in the alpha/beta frequency band was larger for words repeated with their sentence context as compared with words repeated in a new low-constraint context, suggesting that implicit learning happens not only at the level of individual items but additionally improves sentence-based predictions. These processing benefits for repeated sentences did not differ between constraint conditions, suggesting that sentence-based prediction update might be proportional to the amount of unpredicted semantic information, rather than to the precision of the prediction that was violated. In addition, the consequences of high-constraint prediction violations, as reflected in a frontal positivity and increased theta band power, were reduced with repetition. Overall, our findings suggest a powerful and specific adaptation mechanism that allows the language system to quickly adapt its predictions when unexpected semantic information is processed, irrespective of sentence constraint, and to reduce potential costs of strong predictions that were violated.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:21:34","2025-07-19 10:03:41","1048-1070","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Error-based Implicit Learning in Language","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\3WL3B27V\Hodapp和Rabovsky - 2024 - Error-based Implicit Learning in Language The Effect of Sentence Context and Constraint in a Repeti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were required to learn and store orthographic word forms because the pseudoword spellings were not uniquely predictable from sound to letter mappings. With eight learning trials per word form, we observed changes in the brain's response as learning was taking place. Accuracy was evaluated during learning, immediately after scanning, and 1 week later. We found evidence of two distinct learning systems—hippocampal and neocortical—operating during orthographic learning, consistent with the predictions of dual systems theories of learning/memory such as the complementary learning systems framework [McClelland, J.

The bilateral hippocampus and the visual word form area (VWFA) showed significant BOLD response changes over learning, with the former exhibiting a rising pattern and the latter exhibiting a falling pattern. Moreover, greater BOLD signal increase in the hippocampus was associated with better postscan recall. In addition, we identified two distinct bilateral brain networks that mirrored the rising and falling patterns of the hippocampus and VWFA. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that regions within each network were internally synchronized. These novel findings highlight, for the first time, the relevance of multiple learning systems in orthographic learning and provide a paradigm that can be used to address critical gaps in our understanding of the neural bases of orthographic learning in general and orthographic word-form learning specifically.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:21:39","2025-07-19 10:03:44","1071-1098","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\ZID6K4AY\Tao 等 - 2024 - Cortical and Subcortical Mechanisms of Orthographic Word-form Learning.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It examines the neurophysiological correlates (ERPs) of attention to these unexpected stimuli through the use of an oddball paradigm where sequences of repetitive stimuli are occasionally interspersed with a deviant stimulus, allowing for elicitation of an MMN. Whereas previous oddball studies on attention toward unexpected sounds involving pitch rises were conducted on nonlinguistic stimuli, the present study uses as stimuli lexical items in German with naturalistic intonation contours. Results indicate that rising intonation plays a special role in attention orienting at a pre-attentive processing stage, whereas contextual meaning (here a list of items) is essential for activating attentional resources at a conscious processing stage. This is reflected in the activation of distinct brain responses: Rising intonation evokes the largest MMN, whereas falling intonation elicits a less pronounced MMN followed by a P3 (reflecting a conscious processing stage). Subsequently, we also find a complex interplay between the phonological status (i.e., accent/head marking vs. boundary/edge marking) and the direction of pitch change in their contribution to attention orienting: Attention is not oriented necessarily toward a specific position in prosodic structure (head or edge). Rather, we find that the intonation contour itself and the appropriateness of the contour in the linguistic context are the primary cues to two core mechanisms of attention orienting, pre-attentive and conscious orientation respectively, whereas the phonological status of the pitch event plays only a supplementary role.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:21:44","2025-07-19 10:03:47","1099-1122","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Auditory Processing of Intonational Rises and Falls in German","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\TD4NF7AK\Lialiou 等 - 2024 - Auditory Processing of Intonational Rises and Falls in German Rises Are Special in Attention Orient.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the contribution of L-SS integration during nonalphabetic native and alphabetic second language (L2) reading remains unclear. This study explored whether L-SS integration plays a similar role in a nonalphabetic language as in alphabetic languages and its contribution to L2 reading among native Japanese-speaking adults with varying English proficiency. A priming paradigm in Japanese and English was performed by presenting visual letters or symbols, followed by auditory sounds. We compared behavioral and event-related responses elicited by congruent letter–sound pairs, incongruent pairs, and baseline condition (symbol–sound pairs). The behavioral experiment revealed shorter RTs in the congruent condition for Japanese and English tasks, suggesting a facilitation effect of congruency. The ERP experiment results showed an increased early N1 response to Japanese congruent pairs compared to corresponding incongruent stimuli at the left frontotemporal electrodes. Interestingly, advanced English learners exhibited greater activities in bilateral but predominantly right-lateralized frontotemporal regions for the congruent condition within the N1 time window. Moreover, the enhancement of P2 response to congruent pairs was observed in intermediate English learners. These findings indicate that, despite deviations from native language processing, advanced speakers may successfully integrate letters and sounds during English reading, whereas intermediate learners may encounter difficulty in achieving L-SS integration when reading L2. Furthermore, our results suggest that L2 proficiency may affect the level of automaticity in L-SS integration, with the right P2 congruency effect playing a compensatory role for intermediate learners.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:21:49","2025-07-19 10:03:50","1123-1140","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","The Role of Letter–Speech Sound Integration in Native and Second Language Reading","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\83SVDDDV\Yan和Seki - 2024 - The Role of Letter–Speech Sound Integration in Native and Second Language Reading A Study in Native.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One focal point of the debate concerns the role of inferior frontal areas in receptive syntactic ability, which is mostly assessed using sentence comprehension involving complex syntactic structures, a task that is potentially confounded with working memory. Syntactic acceptability judgments may provide a better measure of receptive syntax by reducing the need to use high working memory load and complex sentences and by enabling assessment of various types of syntactic violations. We therefore tested the perception of grammatical violations by people with poststroke aphasia (n = 25), along with matched controls (n = 16), using English sentences involving errors in word order, agreement, or subcategorization. Lesion data were also collected. Control participants performed near ceiling in accuracy with higher discriminability of agreement and subcategorization violations than word order; aphasia participants were less able to discriminate violations, but, on average, paralleled control participants discriminability of types of violations. Lesion-symptom mapping showed a correlation between discriminability and posterior temporal regions, but not inferior frontal regions. We argue that these results diverge from models holding that frontal areas are amodal core regions in syntactic structure building and favor models that posit a core hierarchical system in posterior temporal regions.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:21:53","2025-07-19 10:03:52","1141-1155","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\NWZPGP98\Fahey 等 - 2024 - Lesion-symptom Mapping of Acceptability Judgments in Chronic Poststroke Aphasia Reveals the Neurobio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, we only have started to unravel the neurocognitive mechanisms that help us to find this balance in practice. Analyzing BOLD signals of healthy young adults during virtual foraging, we could show that a behavioral tendency for prolonged exploitation was associated with weakened signaling during exploration in central node points of the frontoparietal attention network, plus the frontopolar cortex. These results provide an important link between behavioral heuristics that we use to balance between exploitation and exploration and the brain function that supports shifts from one tendency to the other.

Conflict adaptation and conflict resolution are crucial aspects of conflict processing. Functional neuroimaging studies have associated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with conflict processing, but its causal role remains somewhat controversial. Moreover, the neuroanatomical basis of conflict processing has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, the Stroop task, a well-established measure of conflict, was employed to investigate (1) the neuroanatomical basis of conflict resolution and conflict adaptation with the voxel-based morphometry analysis, (2) the causal role of DLPFC in conflict processing with the application of the continuous theta burst stimulation to DLPFC. The results revealed that the Stroop effect was correlated to the gray matter volume of the precuneus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum, and the congruency sequence effect was correlated to the gray matter volume of superior frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and lobule paracentral gyrus. These findings indicate the neuroanatomical basis of conflict resolution and adaptation. In addition, the continuous theta burst stimulation over the right DLPFC resulted in a significant reduction in the Stroop effect of RT after congruent trials compared with vertex stimulation and a significant increase in the Stroop effect of accuracy rate after incongruent trials than congruent trials, demonstrating the causal role of right DLPFC in conflict adaptation. Moreover, the DLPFC stimulation did not affect the Stroop effect of RT and accuracy rate.

According to the cortical disconnection hypothesis, age-related changes in the microstructural integrity of white matter may disrupt inter-regional neuronal communication, which in turn can impair behavioral performance. Here, we use fMRI and diffusion-weighted imaging to determine whether age-related differences in white matter microstructure contribute to frontoparietal over-recruitment and behavioral performance during a response inhibition (go/no-go) task in an adult life span sample (n = 145). Older and female participants were slower (go RTs) than younger and male participants, respectively. However, participants across all ages were equally accurate on the no-go trials, suggesting some participants may slow down on go trials to achieve high accuracy on no-go trials. Across the life span, functional recruitment of the frontoparietal network within the left and right hemispheres did not vary as a function of age, nor was it related to white matter fractional anisotropy (FA). In fact, only frontal FA and go RTs jointly mediated the association between age and no-go accuracy. Our results therefore suggest that frontal white matter cortical “disconnection” is an underlying driver of age-related differences in cognitive control, and white matter FA may not fully explain functional task-related activation in the frontoparietal network during the go/no-go task. Our findings add to the literature by demonstrating that white matter may be more important for certain cognitive processes in aging than task-related functional activation.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:22:09","2025-07-19 10:04:01","1184-1205","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\JHU2AK6G\Parimoo 等 - 2024 - Age-related Differences in Response Inhibition Are Mediated by Frontoparietal White Matter but Not F.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To tackle this question, we presented multiple cursors as visual feedback in a center-out reaching task and varied the task relevance of these cursors. In other words, participants were instructed to hit a target with a specific task-relevant cursor, while ignoring the other cursors. In Experiment 1, we found that reach aftereffects were attenuated by the mere presence of distracting cursors, compared with reach aftereffects in response to a single task-relevant cursor. The degree of attenuation did not depend on the position of the distracting cursors. In Experiment 2, we examined the interaction between task relevance and attention. Participants were asked to adapt to a task-relevant cursor/target pair, while ignoring the task-irrelevant cursor/target pair. Critically, we jittered the location of the relevant and irrelevant target in an uncorrelated manner, allowing us to index attention via how well participants tracked the position of target. We found that participants who were better at tracking the task-relevant target/cursor pair showed greater aftereffects, and interestingly, the same correlation applied to the task-irrelevant target/cursor pair. Together, these results highlight a novel role of task relevancy on modulating implicit adaptation, perhaps by giving greater attention to informative sources of feedback, increasing the saliency of the sensory prediction error.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:22:14","2025-07-19 10:04:04","1206-1220","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\YU4EVI9F\Tsay 等 - 2024 - Implicit Adaptation Is Modulated by the Relevance of Feedback.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trajectories of adolescents' perceived parent and peer norms were examined longitudinally with functional neuroimaging (n = 165; ages 11–16 years across three waves; 86 girls, 79 boys; 29.7% White, 21.8% Black, 35.8% Latinx, 12.7% other/multiracial). Behavioral results showed perceived parent norms were less permissive than adolescents' own attitudes about externalizing behaviors, whereas perceived peer norms were more permissive than adolescents' own attitudes, effects that increased from early to middle adolescence. Although younger adolescents reported less permissive attitudes when they spontaneously tracked perceived parent norms in the ventromedial and medial pFCs during self-evaluations, this effect weakened as they aged. No brain–behavior effects were found when tracking perceived peer norms. These findings elucidate how perceived parent and peer norms change in parallel with personal attitudes about externalizing behaviors from early to middle adolescence and underscore the importance of spontaneous neural tracking of perceived parent norms during self-evaluations for buffering permissive personal attitudes, particularly in early adolescence.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:04:09","2025-09-14 10:22:20","2025-07-19 10:04:07","1221-1237","","6","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\8L7TWMCK\Do 等 - 2024 - Neural Tracking of Perceived Parent, but Not Peer, Norms Is Associated with Longitudinal Changes in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we investigated whether VAN is indeed a specific marker of phenomenal awareness or rather reflects the involvement of attention. To this end, we reanalyzed data collected in a previously published EEG experiment in which awareness of visual stimuli and two aspects that define attentional involvement, namely, the inherent saliency and task relevance of a stimulus, were manipulated orthogonally. During the experimental procedure, participants (n = 41) were presented with images of faces that were backward-masked or unmasked, fearful or neutral, and defined as task-relevant targets or task-irrelevant distractors. Single-trial ERP analysis revealed that VAN was highly dependent on attentional manipulations in the early time window (140–200 msec), up to the point that the effect of awareness was not observed for attentionally irrelevant stimuli (i.e., neutral faces presented as distractors). In the late time window (200–350 msec), VAN was present in all attentional conditions, but its amplitude was significantly higher in response to fearful faces and task-relevant face images than in response to neutral ones and task-irrelevant ones, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the amplitude of VAN is highly dependent on both exogenous (stimulus saliency) and endogenous attention (task requirements). Our results challenge the view that VAN constitutes an attention-independent correlate of phenomenal awareness.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:06:35","2025-09-14 10:11:12","2025-07-19 10:06:10","1297-1324","","7","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\ITSUHACC\Doradzińska和Bola - 2024 - Early Electrophysiological Correlates of Perceptual Consciousness Are Affected by Both Exogenous and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pupillometry, the measure of the pupil size, is often used to assess effort but has disadvantages. Analysis of eye movements may provide an alternative, but research has been limited to easy and difficult task demands in younger adults. An effort measure must be sensitive to the whole effort profile, including “giving up” effort investment, and capture effort in different age groups. The current study comprised three experiments in which younger (n = 66) and older (n = 44) adults listened to speech masked by background babble at different signal-to-noise ratios associated with easy, difficult, and impossible speech comprehension. We expected individuals to invest little effort for easy and impossible speech (giving up) but to exert effort for difficult speech. Indeed, pupil size was largest for difficult but lower for easy and impossible speech. In contrast, gaze dispersion decreased with increasing speech masking in both age groups. Critically, gaze dispersion during difficult speech returned to levels similar to easy speech after sentence offset, when acoustic stimulation was similar across conditions, whereas gaze dispersion during impossible speech continued to be reduced. These findings show that a reduction in eye movements is not a byproduct of acoustic factors, but instead suggest that neurocognitive processes, different from arousal-related systems regulating the pupil size, drive reduced eye movements during high task demands. The current data thus show that effort in one sensory domain (audition) differentially impacts distinct functional properties in another sensory domain (vision).","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:06:35","2025-09-14 10:22:38","2025-07-19 10:06:12","1325-1340","","7","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\ID763Z96\Herrmann和Ryan - 2024 - Pupil Size and Eye Movements Differently Index Effort in Both Younger and Older Adults.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report on an fMRI study that utilized a repeated retrieval paradigm to test these ideas. In an MRI scanner, participants retrieved autobiographical memories at three timepoints. During the third retrieval, participants either shifted their focus to the conceptual content of the memory, the perceptual content of the memory, or retrieved the memory as they had done so on previous trials. We observed stronger anterior hippocampal activity for the first retrieval compared with later retrievals, regardless of whether there was a shift in content in those later trials. We also found evidence for separate cortical systems when constructing autobiographical memories with a focus on conceptual or perceptual content. Finally, we found that there was common engagement between later retrievals that required a shift toward conceptual content and the initial retrieval of a memory.

Visualization of stimulus representational dynamics using principal component analysis revealed that the network represented trial context (order of presentation) and priority via different mechanisms.

However, the effect on selective stopping processes (where participants must cancel only one component of a multicomponent movement) remains unknown, despite these complex movements often being required as we navigate our busy modern world. Thirty healthy adults (mean age = 31.1 years, SD = 10.5) completed five response-selective stop signal tasks featuring different combinations of “go signal” modality (the environmental change baring an imperative to initiate movement; auditory or visual) and “stop signal” modality (the environmental change indicating that action cancellation is required: auditory, visual, or audiovisual). EMG recordings of effector muscles allowed detailed comparison of the characteristics of voluntary action and cancellation between tasks. Behavioral and physiological measures of stopping speed demonstrated that the modality of the go signal influenced how quickly participants cancelled movement in response to the stop signal: Stopping was faster in two cross-modal experimental conditions (auditory go – visual stop; visual go – auditory stop), than in two conditions using the same modality for both signals. A separate condition testing for multisensory facilitation revealed that stopping was fastest when the stop signal consisted of a combined audiovisual stimulus, compared with all other go–stop stimulus combinations. These findings provide novel evidence regarding the role of attentional networks in action cancellation and suggest modality-specific cognitive resources influence the latency of the stopping process.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:06:35","2025-09-14 10:22:51","2025-07-19 10:06:22","1395-1411","","7","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\IC3RE68L\Weber 等 - 2024 - Stopping Speed in Response to Auditory and Visual Stop Signals Depends on Go Signal Modality.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This behavior can be studied in the laboratory using the stop-signal task. There remains ambiguity about whether a “point-of-no-return” exists, after which a response cannot be aborted. A separate question concerns whether motor system inhibition associated with attempted stopping persists when stopping is unsuccessful. We address these two questions using electromyography (EMG) in two stop-signal task experiments. Experiment 1 (n = 24) involved simple right and left index finger responses in separate task blocks. Experiment 2 (n = 28) involved a response choice between the right index and pinky fingers. To evaluate the approximate point of no return, we measured EMG in responding fingers during the 100 msec preceding the stop signal and observed significantly greater EMG amplitudes during failed than successful stopping in both experiments. Thus, EMG before the stop signal differentiated success, regardless of whether there was a response choice. To address whether motor inhibition persists after failed stopping, we assessed EMG peak-to-offset durations and slopes (i.e., rate of EMG decline) for go, failed stop, and successful stop (partial response) trials. EMG peak-to-offset was shorter and steeper for failed stopping compared to go and successful stop partial response trials, suggesting motor inhibition persists even when failing to stop. These findings indicate EMG is sensitive to a “transition zone” at which the relative likelihood of stop failure versus success inverts and also suggest peak-to-offset time of response-related EMG activity during failed stopping reflects stopping-related inhibition.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:06:35","2025-09-14 10:22:59","2025-07-19 10:06:25","1412-1426","","7","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\647ESCTF\Fisher 等 - 2024 - Early Rise and Persistent Inhibition of Electromyography during Failed Stopping.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such meaning maker is understanding to whom or to what a pronoun in a discourse refers to. To understand a pronoun, the brain must access matching entities or concepts that have been encoded in memory from previous linguistic context. Models of language processing propose that internally stored linguistic concepts, accessed via exogenous cues such as phonological input of a word, are represented as (a)synchronous activities across a population of neurons active at specific frequency bands. Converging evidence suggests that delta band activity (1–3 Hz) is involved in temporal and representational integration during sentence processing. Moreover, recent advances in the neurobiology of memory suggest that recollection engages neural dynamics similar to those which occurred during memory encoding. Integrating from these two research lines, we here tested the hypothesis that neural dynamic patterns, especially in delta frequency range, underlying referential meaning representation, would be reinstated during pronoun resolution. By leveraging neural decoding techniques (i.e., representational similarity analysis) on a magnetoencephalogram data set acquired during a naturalistic story-listening task, we provide evidence that delta-band activity underlies referential meaning representation. Our findings suggest that, during spoken language comprehension, endogenous linguistic representations such as referential concepts may be proactively retrieved and represented via activation of their underlying dynamic neural patterns.","2024-06-01","2025-07-19 10:06:35","2025-09-14 10:23:08","2025-07-19 10:06:31","1472-1492","","7","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\GVVDGICZ\Ding 等 - 2024 - Delta-band Activity Underlies Referential Meaning Representation during Pronoun Resolution.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, children observing the incompetent speaker revealed weaker representations of novel words indicated by an increased likelihood for selecting familiar but incorrect items upon recall. Modulations in theta and alpha power suggest differential processing of novel label–object pairs depending on the speakers' competence. In the incompetent, but not the competent, speaker condition, increases in prefrontal theta power during anticipation and encoding were related to increased recall success. Findings suggest that theta power in the present study reflects cognitive control.

However, intuition suggests that perceptual experience is richer than these results indicate. Why does it feel like we see so much when the data suggests we see so little? One possibility stems from the fact that experimental studies always present observers with stimuli that they have never seen before. Meanwhile, when forming intuitions about perceptual experience, observers reflect on their experiences with scenes with which they are highly familiar (e.g., their office). Does prior experience with a scene change the bandwidth of perceptual awareness? Here, we asked if observers were better at noticing alterations to the periphery in familiar scenes compared with unfamiliar scenes. We found that observers noticed changes to the periphery more frequently with familiar stimuli. Signal detection theoretic analyses revealed that when observers are unfamiliar with a stimulus, they are less sensitive at noticing (d′) and are more conservative in their response criterion (c). Taken together, these results suggest that prior knowledge expands the bandwidth of perceptual awareness. It should be stressed that these results challenge the widely held idea that prior knowledge fills in perception. Overall, these findings highlight how prior knowledge plays an important role in determining the limits of perceptual experience and is an important factor to consider when attempting to reconcile the tension between empirical observation and personal introspection.","2024-07-01","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-07-19 10:07:57","1546-1556","","8","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\5GRUJI55\Cohen 等 - 2024 - Familiarity Alters the Bandwidth of Perceptual Awareness.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, findings have hitherto rested largely on subjective self-reports, with few studies experimentally investigating both objective and subjective aspects of episodic memory in aphantasia. In this study, we tested both aspects of remembering in aphantasic individuals using a custom 3-D object and spatial memory task that manipulated visuospatial perspective, which is considered to be a key factor determining the subjective experience of remembering. Objective and subjective measures of memory performance were taken for both object and spatial memory features under different perspective conditions. Surprisingly, aphantasic participants were found to be unimpaired on all objective memory measures, including those for object memory features, despite reporting weaker overall mental imagery experience and lower subjective vividness ratings on the memory task. These results add to newly emerging evidence that aphantasia is a heterogenous condition, where some aphantasic individuals may lack metacognitive awareness of mental imagery rather than mental imagery itself. In addition, we found that both participant groups remembered object memory features with greater precision when encoded and retrieved in the first person versus third person, suggesting a first-person perspective might facilitate subjective memory reliving by enhancing the representational quality of scene contents.","2024-07-01","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-07-19 10:08:05","1578-1598","","8","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\AF4GFNPK\Siena和Simons - 2024 - Metacognitive Awareness and the Subjective Experience of Remembering in Aphantasia.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although parents are undoubtedly convinced that their infant is conscious, the lack of adequate experimental paradigms to address this question in preverbal infants has been a hindrance to research on this topic. However, recent behavioral and brain imaging studies have shown that infants are engaged in complex learning from an early age and that their brains are more structured than traditionally thought. I will present a rapid overview of these results, which might provide indirect evidence of early perceptual awareness and then describe how a more systematic approach to this question could stand within the framework of global workspace theory, which identifies specific signatures of conscious perception in adults. Relying on these brain signatures as a benchmark for conscious perception, we can deduce that it exists in the second half of the first year, whereas the evidence before the age of 5 months is less solid, mainly because of the paucity of studies. The question of conscious perception before term remains open, with the possibility of short periods of conscious perception, which would facilitate early learning. Advances in brain imaging and growing interest in this subject should enable us to gain a better understanding of this important issue in the years to come.","2024-07-01","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-09-14 13:11:36","2025-07-19 10:08:07","1599-1609","","8","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Perceptual Awareness in Human Infants","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\LXYFUYTS\Dehaene-Lambertz - 2024 - Perceptual Awareness in Human Infants What is the Evidence.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also propose a biological basis for these three components: the peripheral and central physiology of interoception and exteroception help explain the implementation of the first two components, whereas the third depends on central nervous system integration, at multiple levels, from spinal cord, brainstem, and diencephalic nuclei, to selected regions of the mesial cerebral cortices.","2024-07-01","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-09-14 13:13:16","2025-07-19 10:08:17","1653-1659","","8","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\MFFQ4UVM\Damasio和Damasio - 2024 - Homeostatic Feelings and the Emergence of Consciousness.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The NDS approach holds that consciousness or felt experience is characteristic of systems whose nervous systems have been shaped to realize subjectivity through a combination of network interactions and large-scale dynamic patterns. Features of the vertebrate brain architecture that figure in other accounts of the biology of consciousness are viewed as inessential. Deep phylogenetic branchings in the animal kingdom occurred before the evolution of complex behavior, cognition, and sensing. These capacities arose independently in brain architectures that differ widely across arthropods, vertebrates, and cephalopods, but with conservation of large-scale dynamic patterns of a kind that have an apparent link to felt experience in humans. An evolutionary perspective also motivates a strongly gradualist view of consciousness; a simple distinction between conscious and nonconscious animals will probably be replaced with a view that admits differences of degree, perhaps on many dimensions.","2024-07-01","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-09-14 13:13:30","2025-07-19 10:08:20","1660-1666","","8","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\QRM4JHBT\Godfrey-Smith - 2024 - Inferring Consciousness in Phylogenetically Distant Organisms.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In covert consciousness, there is a discordance between the observed behavior, the traditional bedside mode of assessment, and the response to volitional commands as depicted by neuroimaging or EEG studies. This alphabet soup of acronyms represents both the promise and peril of nascent technology in covert consciousness. On the diagnostic side, there is the complexity and uncertainty of identifying the discordance between cognitive activity and overt behavior. On the therapeutic side, when AI is used to generate speech, there is the possibility of misrepresenting the thoughts and intentions of those who are otherwise voiceless. This concordance of factors makes the application of AI to CMD worthy of deeper consideration. We offer this analysis in the spirit of anticipatory governance, a prudential process by which one plans to prevent or mitigate unintended consequences of novel technology. We first consider the normative challenges posed by CMD for clinical practice, neuroethics, and the law. We then explore the history of covert consciousness and the relationship of severe brain injury to the right-to-die movement, before introducing three biographies of brain injury that highlight the potential impact of disability bias or ableism in clinical practice, assistive technology, and translational research. Subsequently, we explore how AI might give voice to conscious individuals who are unable to communicate and the ethical challenges that this technology must overcome to promote human flourishing drawing upon what Nussbaum and Sen have described as a “capabilities approach” to promote normative reasoning.","2024-07-01","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-09-14 13:13:51","2025-07-19 10:08:22","1667-1674","","8","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Neuroethics, Covert Consciousness, and Disability Rights","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\2E8YS7QD\Fins和Shulman - 2024 - Neuroethics, Covert Consciousness, and Disability Rights What Happens When Artificial Intelligence.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we propose an eigenmodal decomposition approach to detect modules at multi-hierarchy, which can identify higher-layer potential submodules and is consistent with the brain hierarchical structure. We defined three metrics: node configuration matrix, combinability, and separability. Node configuration matrix represents network configuration changes between layers. Separability reflects network configuration from global to local, whereas combinability shows network configuration from local to global. First, we created a random network to verify the feasibility of the method. Results show that separability of real networks is larger than that of random networks, whereas combinability is smaller than random networks. Then, we analyzed a large data set incorporating fMRI data from resting and seven distinct tasking conditions. Experiment results demonstrates the high similarity in node configuration matrices for different task conditions, whereas the tasking states have less separability and greater combinability between modules compared with the resting state. Furthermore, the ability of brain network configuration can predict brain states and cognition performance. Crucially, derived from tasks are highlighted with greater power than resting, showing that task-induced attributes have a greater ability to reveal individual differences. Together, our study provides novel perspectives for analyzing the organization structure of complex brain networks at multi-hierarchy, gives new insights to further unravel the working mechanisms of the brain, and adds new evidence for tasking states to better characterize and predict behavioral traits.","2024-07-01","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-09-14 13:14:47","2025-07-19 10:08:30","1695-1714","","8","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\PXZ6AIFJ\Wang 等 - 2024 - Multi-hierarchy Network Configuration Can Predict Brain States and Performance.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have previously argued that the N300 ERP component serves as an index of the brain's use of representations of (real-world) statistical regularities. However, we do not yet know whether overt attention is necessary in order for this process to engage. We addressed this question by presenting stimuli of either high or low real-world statistical regularity in terms of their representativeness (good/bad exemplars of natural scene categories) to participants who either fully attended the stimuli or were distracted by another task (attended/distracted conditions). Replicating past work, N300 responses were larger to bad than to good scene exemplars, and furthermore, we demonstrate minimal impacts of distraction on N300 effects. Thus, it seems that overtly focused attention is not required to maintain the brain's sensitivity to real-world statistical regularity. Furthermore, in an exploratory analysis, we showed that providing additional, artificial regularities, formed by altering the proportions of good and bad exemplars within blocks, further enhanced the N300 effect in both attended and distracted conditions, shedding light on the relationship between statistical regularities learned in the real world and those learned within the context of an experiment.","2024-07-01","2025-07-19 10:08:39","2025-09-14 13:29:01","2025-07-19 10:08:33","1715-1740","","8","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\X3BIUS5E\Center 等 - 2024 - The Brain's Sensitivity to Real-world Statistical Regularity Does Not Require Full Attention.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of rodent work suggesting that stress may impair the hippocampal pathway involved in episodic memory while sparing or enhancing the pathway involved in statistical learning, we developed a behavioral experiment to investigate the effects of acute stress on both episodic memory and statistical learning in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: stress (socially evaluated cold pressor) immediately before learning, stress ∼15 min before learning, or no stress. In the learning task, participants viewed a series of trial-unique scenes (allowing for episodic encoding of each image) in which certain scene categories reliably followed one another (allowing for statistical learning of associations between paired categories). Memory was assessed 24 hr later to isolate stress effects on encoding/learning rather than retrieval. We found modest support for our hypothesis that acute stress can amplify statistical learning: Only participants stressed ∼15 min in advance exhibited reliable evidence of learning across multiple measures. Furthermore, stress-induced cortisol levels predicted statistical learning retention 24 hr later. In contrast, episodic memory did not differ by stress condition, although we did find preliminary evidence that acute stress promoted memory for statistically predictable information and attenuated competition between statistical and episodic encoding.

However, although multivariate pattern analysis can reveal whether neuronal activity patterns are distinct for different stimulus categories, concerns remain on whether low-level visual features also contribute to the classification results. To circumvent this issue, we applied a cross-decoding approach to magnetoencephalography data from stimuli from two different modalities: images and their corresponding written words. We employed items from three categories and presented them in a randomized order. We show that if the classifier is trained on words, pictures are classified between 150 and 430 msec after stimulus onset, and when training on pictures, words are classified between 225 and 430 msec. The topographical map, identified using a searchlight approach for cross-modal activation in both directions, showed left lateralization, confirming the involvement of linguistic representations.

Recently, we showed that the neural response to monetary reward is enhanced by performing an action, suggesting interactions between neural systems controlling motor behavior and reward processing. Given that many psychiatric disorders are associated with social anhedonia, a key open question is whether such effects generalize to social rewards, and in how far they affect associative learning. We developed a novel task in which participants (n = 66) received social reward feedback and social punishment either by pressing a button or waiting. Predictive cues were linked to feedback valence with 80% accuracy. Using EEG, we measured the neural response to both predictive cues and social feedback. We found enhanced reward positivity for social reward preceded by an action, and an enhanced N2 for cues predicting negative feedback. Cue-locked P3 amplitude was reduced for cues associated with negative feedback in passive trials only, showing a modulation of outcome anticipation by performing a motor action. This was supported by connectivity analyses showing stronger directed theta synchronization, in line with increased top–down modulation of attention, in active compared with passive trials.

The present study compared the segmentation and neural processing of object manipulations and equivalent dough ball manipulations to elucidate the effect of object–action associations. Behavioral data corroborated that objective relational changes in the form of (un-)touchings of objects, hand, and ground represent meaningful anchor points in subjective action segmentation rendering them objective marks of meaningful event boundaries. As expected, segmentation behavior became even more systematic for the weakly informative dough. fMRI data were modeled by critical subjective, and computer-vision-derived objective event boundaries. Whole-brain as well as planned ROI analyses showed that object information had significant effects on how the brain processes these boundaries. This was especially pronounced at untouchings, that is, events that announced the beginning of the upcoming action and might be the point where competing predictions are aligned with perceptual input to update the current action model. As expected, weak object–action associations at untouching events were accompanied by increased biological motion processing, whereas strong object–action associations came with an increased contextual associative information processing, as indicated by increased parahippocampal activity. Interestingly, anterior inferior parietal lobule activity increased for weak object–action associations at untouching events, presumably because of an unrestricted number of candidate actions for dough manipulation.

However, both bottom–up sensory input and top–down attentional modulations thereof appear to prioritize the fovea over the periphery, such that initially peripheral percepts may even be assimilated by foveal processes. This raises the question whether and how visual working memory differs for central and peripheral input. To address this, we conducted a delayed orientation recall task in which an orientation was presented either at the center of the screen or at 15° eccentricity to the left or right. Response accuracy, EEG activity, and gaze position were recorded from 30 participants. Accuracy was slightly but significantly higher for foveal versus peripheral memories. Decoding of EEG recordings revealed a clear dissociation between early sensory and later maintenance signals. Although sensory signals were clearly decodable for foveal stimuli, they were not for peripheral input. In contrast, maintenance signals were equally decodable for both foveal and peripheral memories, suggesting comparable top–down components regardless of eccentricity. Moreover, although memory representations were initially spatially specific and reflected in voltage fluctuations, later during the maintenance period, they generalized across locations, as emerged in alpha oscillations, thus revealing a dynamic transformation within memory from separate sensory traces to what we propose are common output-related codes. Furthermore, the combined absence of reliable decoding of sensory signals and robust presence of maintenance decoding indicates that storage activity patterns as measured by EEG reflect signals beyond primary visual cortex. We discuss the implications for the sensory recruitment hypothesis.","2024-09-01","2025-07-19 10:11:00","2025-09-14 13:29:30","2025-07-19 10:10:29","1807-1826","","9","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\MNTE39L4\Kandemir和Olivers - 2024 - Comparing Neural Correlates of Memory Encoding and Maintenance for Foveal and Peripheral Stimuli.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This physiological phenomenon, which is paralleled in behavior by involuntary retrieval of the UMI, is carried by the beta frequency band, implicating beta-band dynamics in priority coding in working memory. We decomposed EEG data from 12 participants performing double serial retrocuing with concurrent delivery of spTMS using Spatially distributed PhAse Coupling Extraction. This procedure decomposes the scalp-level signal into a set of discrete coupled oscillators, each with a component strength that can vary over time. The decomposition revealed a diversity of low-frequency components, a subset of them strengthening with the onset of the task, and the majority declining in strength across the trial, as well as within each delay period. Results with spTMS revealed no evidence that it works by activating previously “silent” sources; instead, it had the effect of modulating ongoing activity, specifically by exaggerating the within-delay decrease in strength of posterior beta components. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect of spTMS on the loading strength of a posterior beta component correlated with the disruptive effect of spTMS on performance, a pattern also seen when analyses were restricted to trials with “UMI-lure” memory probes. Rather than reflecting the “activation” of a putatively “activity silent” UMI, these results implicate beta-band dynamics in a mechanism that distinguishes prioritized from unprioritized, and suggest that the effect of spTMS is to disrupt this code.","2024-09-01","2025-07-19 10:11:00","2025-09-14 13:29:35","2025-07-19 10:10:31","1827-1846","","9","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\2QEN4LH6\Fulvio 等 - 2024 - Single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Affects Working-memory Performance via Posterior Beta.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study investigated cerebral and behavioral effects of experiencing either multiple alternative versions (“varying”) or one single alternative version (“repetitive”) of a previously encoded episode. Participants encoded a set of episodes (“originals”) by watching videos showing toy stories. During scanning, participants either experienced originals, one single, or multiple alternative versions of the previously encoded episodes. Participants' memory performance was tested through recall of original objects. Varying and repetitive PEs revealed typical brain responses to the detection of mismatching information including inferior frontal and posterior parietal regions, as well as hippocampus, which is further linked to memory reactivation, and the amygdala, known for modulating memory consolidation. Furthermore, experiencing varying and repetitive PEs triggered distinct brain areas as revealed by direct contrast. Among others, experiencing varying versions triggered activity in the caudate, a region that has been associated with PEs. In contrast, repetitive PEs activated brain areas that resembled more those for retrieval of originally encoded episodes. Thus, ACC and posterior cingulate cortex activation seemed to serve both reactivating old and integrating new but similar information in episodic memory. Consistent with neural findings, participants recalled original objects less accurately when only presented with the same, but not varying, PE during fMRI.

Because one option may not be better in all attributes at once, the decision process should include a means of weighing relevant attributes. Most decision-making models solve this problem by computing an integrated value, or utility, for each option from a weighted combination of attributes. However, behavioral anomalies in decision-making, such as context effects, indicate that other attribute-specific computations might be taking place. Here, we tested whether rhesus macaques show evidence of attribute-specific processing in a value-based decision-making task. Monkeys made a series of decisions involving choice options comprising a sweetness and probability attribute. Each attribute was represented by a separate bar with one of two mappings between bar size and the magnitude of the attribute (i.e., bigger = better or bigger = worse). We found that translating across different mappings produced selective impairments in decision-making. Choices were less accurate and preferences were more variable when like attributes differed in mapping, suggesting that preventing monkeys from easily making direct attribute comparisons resulted in less accurate choice behavior. This was not the case when mappings of unalike attributes within the same option were different. Likewise, gaze patterns favored transitions between like attributes over transitions between unalike attributes of the same option, so that like attributes were sampled sequentially to support within-attribute comparisons. Together, these data demonstrate that value-based decisions rely, at least in part, on directly comparing like attributes of multiattribute options.","2024-09-01","2025-07-19 10:11:00","2025-09-14 13:18:16","2025-07-19 10:10:39","1879-1897","","9","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\5KHIAMJV\Perkins 等 - 2024 - Multiattribute Decision-making in Macaques Relies on Direct Attribute Comparisons.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to prior literature, semantic prediction potential amplitudes did not increase as cloze probability increased, suggesting that the component may not reflect prediction during natural language processing. Initial N400 results at the article provided evidence against phonological prediction in language, in line with Nieuwland and colleagues' findings. Strikingly, however, when the surprisal of the prior words in the sentence was included in the analysis, increases in article surprisal were associated with increased N400 amplitudes, consistent with prediction accounts. This relationship between surprisal and N400 amplitude was not observed when the surprisal of the two prior words was low, suggesting that expectation violations at the article may be overlooked under highly predictable conditions. Individual alpha frequency also modulated the relationship between article surprisal and the N400, emphasizing the importance of individual neural factors for prediction.

The ERPs were measured in response to related and unrelated target words. Our results showed an N400 effect (greater amplitudes for unrelated as opposed to related target words) over the left hemisphere, only for the familiar voice, suggesting that the voice familiarity facilitated lexical-semantic activation. For unfamiliar voices, we observed an earlier congruence effect (greater amplitudes for related than for unrelated target words). This suggests that although 18-month-olds process lexical-semantic information from unfamiliar speakers, their neural signatures of lexical-semantic processing are less mature.

This study used a novel approach to analyzing CBv changes occurring in response to 20 tasks from the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III in 40 healthy individuals. The novel approach compared various information entropy families (permutation, Tsallis, and Rényi entropy) and statistical complexity measures based on disequilibrium. Using this approach, we found the majority of the attention, visuospatial, and memory tasks from the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III that showed lower statistical complexity values when compared with the resting state.

Best area under the curve values were 0.91 ± 0.04, p = .001, to distinguish between resting and cognitively active states. Our findings show that brain hemodynamic signals captured with TCD can be used to distinguish between resting state (baseline) and cognitive effort (stimulation paradigms) using entropy and statistical complexity as an alternative method to traditional techniques such as coherent averaging of CBv signals.

We propose that need states exert a pervasive influence on the organism, which in active inference terms translates to a “pervasive surprise”—a measure of the distance from the organism's preferred state. Crucially, we define needing as an active inference process that seeks to reduce this pervasive surprise. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that our proposal successfully captures key aspects of the phenomenology and neurobiology of needing. We show that as need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states strengthens, independently of external reward prediction. Furthermore, need states increase the precision of states (stimuli and actions) leading to preferred states, suggesting their ability to amplify the value of reward cues and rewards themselves.

Self-reported mind wandering episodes usually result in similar behavioral detriments in younger and older adults (e.g., greater RT variability, more task errors). However, the relatively few studies investigating the neural correlates of mind wandering and aging have revealed mixed findings, possibly because they typically rely on infrequent thought probes and, therefore, few trials for neural analyses. In the current study, we propose a method to recover more task data by categorizing trials from a commonly used sustained attention to response task according to RT variability. Behavioral data (n = 49 younger; n = 40 older) revealed that compared with younger adults, older adults reported fewer mind wandering episodes, but showed similar behavioral impacts thereof. Furthermore, in both age groups, subjective reports of mind wandering predicted the more objective sorting of trials into “on-” and “off-task” according to RT variability. Using these objectively sorted trials, we investigated two commonly reported EEG measures of mind wandering (diminished P1 and P3 amplitude) in 26 younger and 24 older adults. Although the P1 did not differ between on- and off-task trials for either group, the P3 was diminished for off-task trials in both age groups (albeit significantly less in older adults) suggesting preserved perceptual but reduced higher-order processing during off-task periods in both groups.","2024-09-01","2025-07-19 10:11:00","2025-09-14 13:30:10","2025-07-19 10:10:57","2029-2044","","9","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Model-based Mind Wandering in Older Adults","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\FJRGQCW5\Henderson 等 - 2024 - Model-based Mind Wandering in Older Adults Age Differences in the Behavioral and Electrophysiologic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Observed age-related correlation increases among disparate cognitive tasks have supported the dedifferentiation hypothesis. We previously showed cross-sectional evidence for age-related correlation decreases instead, supporting an alternative disintegration hypothesis. In the current study, we extended our previous research to a longitudinal sample. We tested 135 participants (20–80 years) at two time points—baseline and 5-year follow-up—on a battery of 12 in-scanner tests, each tapping one of four reference abilities. We performed between-tasks correlations within domain (convergent) and between domain (discriminant) at both the behavioral and neural level, calculating a single measure of construct validity (convergent − discriminant). Cross-sectionally, behavioral construct validity was significantly different from chance at each time point, but longitudinal change was not significant. Analysis by median age split revealed that older adults showed higher behavioral validity, driven by higher discriminant validity (lower between-tasks correlations). Participant-level neural validity decreased over time, with convergent validity consistently greater than discriminant validity; this finding was also observed at the cross-sectional level. In addition, a disproportionate decrease in neural validity with age remained significant after controlling for demographic factors. Factors predicting longitudinal changes in global cognition (mean performance across all 12 tasks) included age, change in neural validity, education, and National Adult Reading Test (premorbid intelligence). Change in neural validity partially mediated the effect of age on change in global cognition. Our findings support the theory of age-related disintegration, linking cognitive decline to changes in neural representations over time.","2024-09-01","2025-07-19 10:11:00","2025-09-14 13:30:14","2025-07-19 10:11:00","2045-2066","","9","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Age-related Disintegration in Functional Connectivity","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\H2JBLDXL\Argiris 等 - 2024 - Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Age-related Disintegration in Functional Connectivity Reference Ab.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether this effect is dependent on motor-based or general predictive mechanisms is unclear. Using a paradigm, in which actions (button presses) elicited tones in only half the trials, this study examined how the processing of the tones is modulated by the prediction error in each trial in a self-performed action compared with action observation. In addition, we considered the effect of temporal predictability by adding a third condition, in which visual cues were followed by external tones in half the trials. The attenuation result patterns differed for N1 and P2 amplitudes, but neither showed an attenuation effect beyond temporal predictability. Interestingly, we found that both N1 and P2 amplitudes reflected prediction errors derived from a reinforcement learning model, in that larger errors coincided with larger amplitudes. This effect was stronger for tones following button presses compared with cued external tones, but only for self-performed and not for observed actions. Taken together, our results suggest that attenuation effects are partially driven by general predictive mechanisms irrespective of self-performed actions. However, the stronger prediction-error effects for self-generated tones suggest that distinct motor-related factors beyond temporal predictability, potentially linked to reinforcement learning, play a role in the underlying mechanisms. Further research is needed to validate these initial findings as the calculation of the prediction errors was limited by the design of the experiment.","2024-10-01","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2025-09-14 13:30:19","2025-07-19 10:12:21","2067-2083","","10","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Fifty Percent of the Time, Tones Come Every Time","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\RPT8XPLQ\Egan 等 - 2024 - Fifty Percent of the Time, Tones Come Every Time Stronger Prediction Error Effects on Neurophysiolo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The automatic extraction of potential paths in a scene, also referred to as navigational affordance, is supported by scene-selective regions (SSRs) that enable efficient human navigation. Recent evidence suggests that the activity of these SSRs can be influenced by information from adjacent spatial memory areas. However, it remains unexplored how this contextual information could influence the extraction of bottom–up information, such as navigational affordances, from a scene and the underlying neural dynamics. Therefore, we analyzed ERPs in 26 young adults performing scene and spatial memory tasks in artificially generated rooms with varying numbers and locations of available doorways. We found that increasing the number of navigational affordances only impaired performance in the spatial memory task. ERP results showed a similar pattern of activity for both tasks, but with increased P2 amplitude in the spatial memory task compared with the scene memory. Finally, we reported no modulation of the P2 component by the number of affordances in either task. This modulation of early markers of visual processing suggests that the dynamics of SSR activity are influenced by a priori knowledge, with increased amplitude when participants have more contextual information about the perceived scene. Overall, our results suggest that prior spatial knowledge about the scene, such as the location of a goal, modulates early cortical activity associated with SSRs, and that this information may interact with bottom–up processing of scene content, such as navigational affordances.","2024-10-01","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2025-09-14 13:30:23","2025-07-19 10:12:24","2084-2099","","10","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\96Z38LBS\Naveilhan 等 - 2024 - Spatial Contextual Information Modulates Affordance Processing and Early Electrophysiological Marker.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we test the hypothesis that these mnemonic effects of rhythm reflect the coupling of high-frequency (gamma) oscillations to entrained lower-frequency oscillations synchronized to the beat of the rhythm. In Study 1, we first test this hypothesis in the context of global effects of rhythm on memory, when memory is superior for visual stimuli presented in rhythmic compared with arrhythmic patterns at encoding [Jones, A., &amp; Ward, E. V. Rhythmic temporal structure at encoding enhances recognition memory, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 31, 1549–1562, 2019]. We found that rhythmic presentation of visual stimuli during encoding was associated with greater phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between entrained low-frequency (delta) oscillations and higher-frequency (gamma) oscillations. In Study 2, we next investigated cross-frequency PAC in the context of local effects of rhythm on memory encoding, when memory is superior for visual stimuli presented in-synchrony compared with out-of-synchrony with a background auditory beat [Hickey, P., Merseal, H., Patel, A.

Furthermore, the magnitude of gamma power modulations positively scaled with the subsequent memory benefit for in- versus out-of-synchrony stimuli. Together, these results suggest that the influence of rhythm on memory encoding may reflect the temporal coordination of higher-frequency gamma activity by entrained low-frequency oscillations.","2024-10-01","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2025-09-14 13:30:27","2025-07-19 10:12:27","2100-2116","","10","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\ETSVSTU5\Townsend 等 - 2024 - Rhythmic Temporal Cues Coordinate Cross-frequency Phase-amplitude Coupling during Memory Encoding.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, changes made to an item in working memory would be expected to influence its subsequent retention. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppressing information from working memory, which can reduce short-term access to that information, may also alter its long-term neural representation. We obtained fMRI data (n = 25; 13 female / 12 male participants) while participants completed a working memory removal task with scene images as stimuli, followed by a final surprise recognition test of the examined items. We applied a multivariate pattern analysis to the data to quantify the engagement of suppression on each trial, to track the contents of working memory during suppression, and to assess representational changes afterward. Our analysis confirms previous reports that suppression of information in working memory involves focused attention to target and remove unwanted information. Furthermore, our findings provide new evidence that even a single dose of suppression of an item in working memory can (if engaged with sufficient strength) produce lasting changes in its neural representation, particularly weakening the unique, item-specific features, which leads to forgetting.

It has been suggested that this location shift reflects a change in the content of representations, from predominantly visual during encoding to primarily semantic during retrieval. Yet, direct evidence on the nature of encoding and retrieval representations is lacking. It is also unclear how the representations mediating the encoding–retrieval shift contribute to memory performance. To investigate these two issues, in the current fMRI study, participants encoded pictures (e.g., picture of a cardinal) and later performed a word recognition test (e.g., word “cardinal”). Representational similarity analyses examined how visual (e.g., red color) and semantic representations (e.g., what cardinals eat) support successful encoding and retrieval. These analyses revealed two novel findings. First, successful memory was associated with representational changes in cortical location (from occipito-temporal at encoding to parietal at retrieval) but not with changes in representational content (visual vs. semantic). Thus, the representational encoding–retrieval shift cannot be easily attributed to a change in the nature of representations. Second, in parietal regions, stronger representations predicted encoding failure but retrieval success. This encoding–retrieval “flip” in representations mimics the one previously reported in univariate activation studies. In summary, by answering important questions regarding the content and contributions to the performance of the representations mediating the encoding–retrieval shift, our findings clarify the neural mechanisms of this intriguing phenomenon.","2024-10-01","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2025-09-14 13:30:37","2025-07-19 10:12:32","2137-2165","","10","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\9D4W2K23\Howard 等 - 2024 - Differential Mnemonic Contributions of Cortical Representations during Encoding and Retrieval.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consistent with this, we recently showed that attention is more strongly biased by VWM representations of objects when we plan to act on those objects in the future. Using EEG and eye tracking, here, we investigated neurophysiological correlates of the interactions between VWM and action. Participants (n = 36) memorized a shape for a subsequent VWM test. At test, a probe was presented along with a secondary object. In the action condition, participants gripped the actual probe if it matched the memorized shape, whereas in the control condition, they gripped the secondary object. Crucially, during the VWM delay, participants engaged in a visual selection task, in which they located a target as fast as possible. The memorized shape could either encircle the target (congruent trials) or a distractor (incongruent trials). Replicating previous findings, we found that eye gaze was biased toward the VWM-matching shape and, importantly, more so when the shape was directly associated with an action plan. Moreover, the ERP results revealed that during the selection task, future action-relevant VWM-matching shapes elicited (1) a stronger Ppc (posterior positivity contralateral), signaling greater attentional saliency; (2) an earlier PD (distractor positivity) component, suggesting faster suppression; (3) a larger inverse (i.e., positive) sustained posterior contralateral negativity in incongruent trials, consistent with stronger suppression of action-associated distractors; and (4) an enhanced response-locked positivity over left motor regions, possibly indicating enhanced inhibition of the response associated with the memorized item during the interim task. Overall, these results suggest that action planning renders objects in VWM more attentionally salient, supporting the notion of selection-for-action in working memory.","2024-10-01","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2025-09-14 13:30:42","2025-07-19 10:12:35","2166-2183","","10","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\LGV2SNRK\Trentin 等 - 2024 - Action Planning Renders Objects in Working Memory More Attentionally Salient.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second objective was to assess the impact of several factors (age, baseline performance, target, brain structure, and activity) on post-TMS SPiN improvement. The results revealed that participants with lower baseline performance were more likely to improve.

For instance, if a speaker previously refers to a piece of furniture as a “couch,” in subsequent references, listeners would expect the speaker to repeat this label instead of switching to an alternative label such as “sofa.” Moreover, it has been found that speakers' demographic backgrounds, often inferred from their voice, influence how listeners process their language. The question in focus, therefore, is whether speaker demographics influence how listeners expect the speaker to repeat or switch labels. In this study, we used ERPs to investigate whether listeners expect a child speaker to be less likely to switch labels compared to an adult speaker, given the common belief that children are less flexible in language use. In the experiment, we used 80 pictures with alternative labels in Mandarin Chinese (e.g., yi1sheng1 vs. dai4fu, “doctor”). Each picture was presented twice over two experimental phases: In the establishment phase, participants listened to an adult or a child naming a picture with one of the labels and decided whether the label matched the picture they saw; in the test phase, participants listened to the same speaker naming the same picture by either repeating the original label or switching to an alternative label and, again, decided whether the label matched the picture they saw. ERP results in the test phase revealed that, compared to repeated labels, switched labels elicited an N400 effect (300–600 msec after label onset) and a P600 effect (600–1000 msec after label onset). Critically, the N400 effect was larger when listeners were exposed to the child speaker than to the adult speaker, suggesting that listeners found a switched label harder to comprehend when it was produced by a child speaker than an adult speaker. Our study shows that the perceived speaker demographic backgrounds influence listeners' neural responses to spoken words, particularly in relation to their expectations regarding the speaker's label switching behavior. This finding contributes to a broader understanding of the relationship between social cognition and language processing.","2024-10-01","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2025-09-14 13:30:50","2025-07-19 10:12:40","2208-2226","","10","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\K4PC6XHT\Wu 等 - 2024 - Speaker Demographics Modulate Listeners' Neural Correlates of Spoken Word Processing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a detailed account of the different frequency effects involved in LDs by (1) dividing LDs into processing stages using a combination of hidden semi-Markov models and multivariate pattern analysis applied to EEG data and (2) using generalized additive mixed models to investigate how the effect of continuous word and nonword frequency differs between these stages. We discovered six stages shared between word types, with the fifth stage consisting of two substages for pseudowords only. In the earliest stages, visual processing was completed faster for frequent words, but took longer for word-like nonwords. Later stages involved an orthographic familiarity assessment followed by an elaborate decision process, both affected differently by frequency.

Activation-based lesion symptom mapping revealed that higher BOLD signal in the left anterior temporal lobe during an in-house naming task was associated with a greater proportion of taxonomic errors on the Philadelphia Naming Test administered outside of the scanner. A lower BOLD signal in the bilateral angular gyrus, precuneus, and right inferior frontal cortex was associated with a greater proportion of taxonomic errors.

However, it is unclear how musical expertise impacts implicit time perception. Twenty nonmusicians and 15 expert musicians participated in an EEG recording during a passive auditory oddball paradigm with 0.8- and 1.6-sec standard time intervals and deviant intervals that were either played earlier or delayed relative to the standard interval. We first confirmed that, as was the case for nonmusicians, musicians use different neurofunctional processes to support the perception of short (below 1.2 sec) and long (above 1.2 sec) time intervals: Whereas deviance detection for long intervals elicited a N1 component, P2 was associated with deviance detection for short time intervals. Interestingly, musicians did not elicit a contingent negative variation (CNV) for longer intervals but show additional components of deviance detection such as (i) an attention-related N1 component, even for deviants occurring during short intervals; (ii) a N2 component for above and below 1.2-sec deviance detection, and (iii) a P2 component for above 1.2-sec deviance detection. We propose that the N2 component is a marker of explicit deviance detection and acts as an inhibitory/conflict monitoring of the deviance. This hypothesis was supported by a positive correlation between CNV and N2 amplitudes: The CNV reflects the temporal accumulator and can predict explicit detection of the deviance. In expert musicians, a N2 component is observable without CNV, suggesting that deviance detection is optimized and does not require the temporal accumulator. Overall, this study suggests that musical expertise is associated with optimized implicit time perception.","2024-10-01","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2025-09-14 13:31:01","2025-07-19 10:12:48","2268-2280","","10","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Musical Expertise Influences the Processing of Short and Long Auditory Time Intervals","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\4KBSAZE3\Thibault 等 - 2024 - Musical Expertise Influences the Processing of Short and Long Auditory Time Intervals An Electroenc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the apparent independence of SDBOLD and meanBOLD may reflect the presence of deactivations; we hypothesize that although SDBOLD may not be related to raw meanBOLD, it will be linearly related to “absolute” meanBOLD. Second, the observed relationship between SDBOLD and performance may be an artifact of using fixed-length trials longer than RTs. Such designs provide opportunities to toggle between on- and off-task states, and fast responders likely engage in more frequent state-switching, thereby artificially elevating SDBOLD. We hypothesize that SDBOLD will be higher and more strongly related to performance when using such fixed-length trials relative to self-paced trials that terminate upon a response. We test these two hypotheses in an fMRI study using blocks of fixed-length or self-paced trials. Results confirmed both hypotheses: (1) SDBOLD was robustly related with absolute meanBOLD, and (2) toggling between on- and off-task states during fixed-length trials reliably contributed to SDBOLD. Together, these findings suggest that a reappraisal of the functional significance of SDBOLD as a unique marker of cognitive performance is warranted.","2024-10-01","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2025-09-14 13:31:05","2025-07-19 10:12:51","2281-2297","","10","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\957LZUTV\Roberts 等 - 2024 - Reassessing the Functional Significance of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Signal Variability.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite strong evidence that the hippocampus plays a critical role in sequential processing, the involvement of the MTL in timing per se is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether patients with MTL damage exhibit differential performance on a temporal distance memory task. Critically, we manipulated context shifts, or boundaries, which have been shown to interfere with associative binding, leading to increases in subjective temporal distance. We predicted that patients with MTL damage would show impaired binding across boundaries and thus fail to show temporal expansion. Consistent with this hypothesis, unilateral patients failed to show a temporal expansion effect, and bilateral patients actually exhibited the reverse effect, suggesting a critical role for the MTL in binding temporal information across boundaries. Furthermore, patients were impaired overall on both the temporal distance memory task and recognition memory, but not on an independent, short-timescale temporal perception task. Interestingly, temporal distance performance could be independently predicted by performance on recognition memory and the short temporal perception task. Together, these data suggest that distinct mnemonic and temporal processes may influence long interval temporal memory and that damage to the MTL may impair the ability to integrate episodic and temporal information in memory.","2024-11-01","2025-07-19 10:14:32","2025-09-14 10:18:17","2025-07-19 10:13:56","2302-2316","","11","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\US2AZ3Q3\DuBrow 等 - 2024 - Medial Temporal Lobe Damage Impairs Temporal Integration in Episodic Memory.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How are the response profiles of cortical areas at event boundaries modulated by boundary strength during complex, naturalistic movie-viewing? Do cortical responses scale in a graded manner with boundary strength, or do they merely detect boundaries in a binary fashion? We measured “cortical boundary shifts” as transient changes in multivoxel patterns at event boundaries with different strengths (weak, moderate, and strong), determined by across-participant agreement. Cortical regions with different processing timescales were examined. In auditory areas, which have short timescales, cortical boundary shifts exhibited a clearly graded profile in both group-level and individual-level analyses. In cortical areas with long timescales, including the default mode network, boundary strength modulated pattern shift magnitude at the individual participant level. We also observed a positive relationship between boundary strength and the extent of temporal alignment of boundary shifts across different levels of the cortical hierarchy. In addition, hippocampal activity was highest at event boundaries for which cortical boundary shifts were most aligned across hierarchical levels. Overall, we found that event boundary strength modulated cortical pattern shifts strongly in sensory areas and more weakly in higher-level areas and that stronger boundaries were associated with greater alignment of these shifts across the cortical hierarchy.","2024-11-01","2025-07-19 10:14:32","2025-09-14 10:18:42","2025-07-19 10:13:59","2317-2342","","11","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\NZWNLUDL\Lee和Chen - 2024 - The Relationship between Event Boundary Strength and Pattern Shifts across the Cortical Hierarchy du.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Across contexts, we manipulated the order of target locations: at a short timescale, the order of pairs of sequential locations in which the target appeared; at a longer timescale, the set of locations that appeared in the first versus the second half of the game. Participants periodically predicted the upcoming target location, and later performed similarity judgments comparing the games based on their order properties. Participants showed context-dependent sensitivity to order information at both short and long timescales, with evidence of stronger learning for short timescales. We modeled the learning paradigm using a gated recurrent network trained to make immediate predictions, which demonstrated multilevel learning timecourses and patterns of sensitivity to the similarity structure of the games that mirrored human participants.

We motivate this argument by integrating seminal findings across several distinct literatures and methodologies. Specifically, we consider key insights from foundational behavioral studies of temporal memory, recent electrophysiological and neuroimaging approaches to measuring memory reinstatement, and computational models that describe how temporal context representations shape memory processes. We also note several open questions concerning how temporal context reinstatement might influence subsequent temporal memory, including potential mediating effects of event spacing and event boundaries.

For instance, if the event was learned out of linear order, one can recall events according to the time they were learned (temporal), similar events (semantic), events occurring nearby in time (chronological), or events produced by the current event (causal). To disentangle the importance of these factors, we had participants watch the nonlinear narrative, Memento, under different task instructions and presentation orders. For each scene of the film, we also separately computed semantic and causal networks. We then contrasted the evidence for temporal, semantic, chronological, or causal strategies during recall. Critically, there was stronger evidence for the causal and chronological strategies than semantic or temporal strategies. Moreover, the causal and chronological strategies outperformed the temporal one even when we asked participants to recall the film in the presented order, underscoring the fundamental nature of causal structure in scaffolding understanding and organizing recall. Nevertheless, time still marginally predicted recall transitions, suggesting it operates as a weak signal in the presence of more salient forms of structure. In addition, semantic and causal network properties predicted scene memorability, including a stronger role for incoming causes to an event than its outgoing effects.

Here, we review and explore the relationship between event processing and recall with the perspective that it can be uniquely characterized by the contributions of the hippocampus and its interactions with the rest of the brain.

Here, we review the roles of midbrain dopamine, the locus coeruleus, and the hippocampus in event cognition to propose and simulate the theoretical influence of two prediction error signals in integrating versus segmenting events in memory. We suggest that signed reward prediction errors can build mental models of reward environments, increasing the contextual similarity (integration) of experiences with stronger, more stable reward expectations. On the other hand, unsigned reward prediction errors can signal a new model of the environment, generating a contextual shift (segmentation) between experiences that crossed them. We moreover predicted that these differences in contextual similarity give rise to distinct patterns of temporal-order memory. We combined these ideas in a computational model to account for a seemingly paradoxical pattern of temporal-order memory where greater representational distance helps order memory within context but impairs it across contexts. We found that simulating signed reward prediction error integration and unsigned reward prediction error segmentation differentially enabled the model to perform associative chaining, which involved reactivating items between two tested probes to assist with sequential retrieval. In summary, our simulations provide a unifying explanation for the varied ways that neuromodulatory systems may alter event cognition and memory.","2024-11-01","2025-07-19 10:14:32","2025-09-14 09:59:56","2025-07-19 10:14:12","2401-2414","","11","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Building and Breaking the Chain","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\U35WXYQC\Rouhani 等 - 2024 - Building and Breaking the Chain A Model of Reward Prediction Error Integration and Segmentation of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, our memory systems must organize and prioritize the details from an experience that can adaptively guide the storage and retrieval of specific episodic events. Prior work has shown that shifts in internal goal states can function as event boundaries, chunking experiences into distinct and memorable episodes. In addition, at short delays, memory for contextual information at boundaries has been shown to be enhanced compared with items within each event. However, it remains unclear if these memory enhancements are limited to features that signal a meaningful transition between events. To determine how changes in dynamic goal states influence the organization and content of long-term memory, we designed a 2-day experiment in which participants viewed a series of black-and-white objects surrounded by a color border on a two-by-two grid. The location of the object on the grid determined which of two tasks participants performed on a given trial. To examine if distinct types of goal shifts modulate the effects of event segmentation, we changed the border color, the task, or both after every four items in a sequence. We found that goal shifts influenced temporal memory in a manner consistent with the formation of distinct events. However, for subjective memory representations in particular, these effects differed by the type of event boundary. Furthermore, to examine if goal shifts lead to the prioritization of goal-relevant features in longer lasting memories, we tested source memory for each object's color and grid location both immediately and after a 24-hr delay. On the immediate test, boundaries enhanced the memory for all concurrent source features compared with nonboundary items, but only if those boundaries involved a goal shift. In contrast, after a delay, the source memory was selectively enhanced for the feature relevant to the goal shift. These findings suggest that goals can adaptively structure memories by prioritizing contextual features that define a unique episode in memory.","2024-11-01","2025-07-19 10:14:32","2025-09-14 09:49:20","2025-07-19 10:14:14","2415-2431","","11","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\PU6EXJ58\Cowan 等 - 2024 - Goal Shifts Structure Memories and Prioritize Event-defining Information in Memory.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examine how temporal information is used in latent-cause inference, using a novel task in which participants see “microbe” stimuli and explicitly report the latent cause (“strain”) they infer for each microbe. We show that humans incorporate time in their inference of latent causes, such that recently inferred latent causes are more likely to be inferred again.

Although attentional modulation of several early sensory ERPs is well established, there is still debate about under what circumstances attention affects the earliest cortical visual evoked response—the C1 ERP component—which is putatively generated from afferent input into primary visual cortex. Moreover, the effects of spatial attention on the recently discovered ERP signature of evidence accumulation—the central parietal positivity (CPP)—have not been fully characterized. The present study assessed the effect of spatial attention on the C1 and CPP components through a spatially cued contrast discrimination task using stimuli that were specifically designed to produce large-amplitude C1 responses and that varied in sensory evidence strength to characterize the CPP. Participants responded according to which of two checkerboard stimuli had greater contrast following an 80% valid cue toward the upper or lower visual field. Prestimulus alpha power changed topographically based on the cue, suggesting participants shifted attention to prepare for the upcoming stimuli. Despite these attentional shifts in alpha power and the fact that the stimuli reliably elicited C1 responses several times greater than many prior studies, there was no evidence of an attention effect on the C1.

Situation model maintenance is supported by the default mode network (DMN), but comprehension of the individual moments in the narrative relies on access to the conceptual store within the semantic system. The present study examined how these systems are engaged by different narrative content to investigate whether highly informative, or semantic, content is a particularly strong driver of semantic system activation compared with contextually driven content that requires using the situation model, which might instead engage DMN regions. The study further investigated which subregions of the graded semantic hub in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) were engaged by the type of narrative content. To do this, we quantified the semantic, pragmatic, social, ambiguous, and emotional content for each sentence in a complete narrative, the English translation of The Little Prince. Increased activation in the transmodal hub in the ventral ATL was only observed for high semantic (i.e., informative) relative to low semantic sentences. Activation in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral ATL subregions was observed for both high relative to low semantic and social content sentences, but the ventrolateral ATL effects were more extensive in the social condition. There was high correspondence between the social and pragmatic content results, particularly in the ventrolateral ATL. We argue that the ventrolateral ATL may be particularly engaged by internal, or endogenous, processing demands, aided by functional connections between the anterior middle temporal gyrus and the DMN. Pragmatic and social content may have driven endogenous processing given the pervasive and plot-progressing nature of this content in the narrative. We put forward a revised account of how the semantic system is engaged in naturalistic contexts, a critical step toward better understanding real-world semantic and social processing.","2024-11-01","2025-07-19 10:14:32","2025-09-14 09:44:18","2025-07-19 10:14:29","2495-2517","","11","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","“All the Stars Will Be Wells with a Rusty Pulley”","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\GUUSPH68\Thye 等 - 2024 - “All the Stars Will Be Wells with a Rusty Pulley” Neural Processing of the Social and Pragmatic Con.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concerns have been raised about the validity of trait mindfulness scales. Despite this, there is extensive literature correlating mindfulness scales with objective brain measures, with the goal of providing insight into mechanisms of mindfulness, and insight into associated positive mental health outcomes. Here, we systematically examined the neural correlates of trait mindfulness. We assessed 68 correlational studies across structural magnetic resonance imaging, task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI, and EEG. Several consistent findings were identified, associating greater trait mindfulness with decreased amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli, increased cortical thickness in frontal regions and insular cortex regions, and decreased connectivity within the default-mode network. These findings converged with results from intervention studies and those that included mindfulness experts. On the other hand, the connections between trait mindfulness and EEG metrics remain inconclusive, as do the associations between trait mindfulness and between-network resting-state fMRI metrics. ERP measures from EEG used to measure attentional or emotional processing may not show reliable individual variation. Research on body awareness and self-relevant processing is scarce. For a more robust correlational neuroscience of trait mindfulness, we recommend larger sample sizes, data-driven, multivariate approaches to self-report and brain measures, and careful consideration of test–retest reliability. In addition, we should leave behind simplistic explanations of mindfulness, as there are many ways to be mindful, and leave behind simplistic explanations of the brain, as distributed networks of brain areas support mindfulness.","2024-11-01","2025-07-19 10:14:32","2025-09-14 09:43:30","2025-07-19 10:14:32","2518-2555","","11","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","The Mindful Brain","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\H2IKBHEI\Treves 等 - 2024 - The Mindful Brain A Systematic Review of the Neural Correlates of Trait Mindfulness.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By grounding physiological responses and behavior in neuroanatomy, the framework provided a critical guide for understanding vision. Although the framework has evolved over time, as our understanding of the physiology and neuroanatomy expanded, cortical visual processing is still often conceptualized as two separate pathways emerging from the primary visual cortex that support distinct behaviors (“what” vs. “where/how”). Here, we take a historical perspective and review the continuing evolution of the framework, discussing key and often overlooked insights. Rather than a functional and neuroanatomical bifurcation into two independent serial, hierarchical pathways, the current evidence points to two highly recurrent heterarchies with heterogeneous connections to cortical regions and subcortical structures that flexibly support a wide variety of behaviors. Although many of the simplifying assumptions of the framework are belied by the evidence gathered since its initial proposal, the core insight of grounding function and behavior in neuroanatomy remains fundamental.

It remains widely accepted that the ventral stream is critical for behaviors that depend on image analysis, for example, recognizing objects. The ventral visual stream is a hierarchically organized sequence of architectonically and physiologically identified brain regions starting in V1 and presumably ending in area TE of inferior temporal (IT) cortex (Ungerleider &amp; Mishkin, 1982; Hubel, 1979; Gross, Rocha-Miranda, &amp; Bender, 1972; Hubel &amp; Wiesel, 1962). After removal of primary visual cortex, primates are blind. After removal of TE, a comparably large brain region, the monkeys have disturbances in discriminating or recognizing objects based on vision; if not tested carefully, they can appear to casual inspection to have no visual deficit (Buffalo, Bertini, Ungerleider, &amp; Desimone, 2005; Weiskrantz &amp; Saunders, 1984; Kikuchi &amp; Iwai, 1980; Ettlinger, Iwai, Mishkin, &amp; Rosvold, 1968; Iwai &amp; Mishkin, 1968). The hierarchy is perhaps most easily seen in the selectivity of the neurons. Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), the beginning of the stream, code for small receptive fields and simple features—bars and edges. Neurons in IT cortex, the termination of the ventral stream, code for complex images, including faces, hands, inanimate objects, and features in scenes (Lafer-Sousa, Conway, &amp; Kanwisher, 2016; Gross et al., 1972). Neurons between V1 and TE have intermediate size receptive fields considered to be proportional in size to their position in the hierarchy.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 06:58:33","2025-07-19 10:16:46","2580-2583","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\HP64DJRI\Richmond和Eldridge - 2024 - Behavioral Studies Reveal Functional Differences in Image Processing by Ventral Stream Areas TEO and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This strict division of labor has faced challenges in light of compelling evidence revealing robust shape and object selectivity within the putative “where” pathway. This article reviews evidence that supports the presence of shape selectivity in the dorsal pathway. A comparative examination of dorsal and ventral object representations in terms of invariance, task dependency, and representational content reveals similarities and differences between the two pathways. Both exhibit some level of tolerance to image transformations and are influenced by tasks, but responses in the dorsal pathway show weaker tolerance and stronger task modulations than those in the ventral pathway. Furthermore, an examination of their representational content highlights a divergence between the responses in the two pathways, suggesting that they are sensitive to distinct features of objects. Collectively, these findings suggest that two networks exist in the human brain for processing object shapes, one in the dorsal and another in the ventral visual cortex. These studies lay the foundation for future research aimed at revealing the precise roles the two “what” networks play in our ability to understand and interact with objects.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 06:58:29","2025-07-19 10:16:49","2584-2593","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\T7BLBCPC\Vaziri-Pashkam - 2024 - Two “What” Networks in the Human Brain.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over time, this model underwent a number of revisions and expansions. In one of her last scientific contributions, Leslie proposed a third visual stream specialized for representing dynamic signals related to social perception. This alteration invites the question: What is a visual stream, and how are different visual streams individuated? In this article, we first consider and reject a simple answer to this question based on a common idealizing visualization of the model, which conflicts with the complexities of the visual system that the model was intended to capture. Next, we propose a taxonomic answer that takes inspiration from the philosophy of science and Leslie's body of work, which distinguishes between neural mechanisms, pathways, and streams. In this taxonomy, visual streams are superordinate to pathways and mechanisms and provide individuation conditions for determining whether collections of cortical connections delineate different visual streams.

Human participants (n = 30) were scanned with fMRI while viewing moving and static stimuli from four categories (faces, bodies, scenes, and objects). A whole-brain group analysis showed that moving bodies and moving objects increased neural responses in the bilateral posterior parietal cortex, parts of the dorsal pathway. By contrast, moving faces and moving bodies increased neural responses, the superior temporal sulcus, part of the third pathway. This pattern of results was also supported by a separate ROI analysis showing that moving stimuli produced more robust neural responses for all visual object categories, particularly in lateral and dorsal brain areas.

Interblob distance, blob cross-sectional area, OD width, and OD arrangement pattern were analyzed in CytOx-reacted tangential sections of flat-mounted V1 preparations. Monocular deprivation induces differential expression of CytOx in the corresponding ODs in V1. We were thereby able to identify the V1 regions associated with the lesioned area in the retina, assign which OD was associated with each eye, and assign the corresponding blob in Layer III as deprived or nondeprived of visual input. We found that nondeprived blobs are more conspicuously stained than blobs outside the lesioned area. Notably, we found a selective expansion of blobs associated with the nonlesioned eye, whereas blobs associated with the deprived eye showed no significant change in size. Blob size in the latter condition was similar to the one observed in normal participants. These effects were present throughout the representation of the lesion in V1, suggesting that the underlying plasticity mechanisms do not depend on eccentricity. Retinal lesion caused no change in interblob distance, which was comparable to the normal brain (i.e., participants with no retinal lesion). This indicates that blob center is a stable hallmark of cortical organization. Finally, the width of ODs associated with the nonlesioned eye tended to be larger compared with ODs of the lesioned eye. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance. The stability of ODs thereby contrasts with blob plasticity, suggesting that the retinal lesion-triggered imbalance in the thalamocortical projection to Layer IVc has a limited impact on OD CytOx reactivity. On the other hand, we argue that ocular imbalance supports intracortical lateral competition that increases CytOx reactivity in the periblob region associated with the nonlesioned eye, accounting for the blob expansion we observe.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 07:01:02","2025-07-19 10:17:01","2652-2666","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\NWHHNK7D\Marcondes 等 - 2024 - Impact of Monocular Retinal Lesions on Blob Size in Adult Human V1.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emotional experiences can greatly enhance contextual memory. However, sufficiently intense emotional signals can have the opposite effect, leading to weaker or less specific memories. How can emotional signals have such intensity-dependent effects? A plausible mechanistic account has emerged from recent anatomical data on the impact of the amygdala on the hippocampus in primates. In hippocampal CA3, the amygdala formed potent synapses on pyramidal neurons, calretinin (CR) interneurons, as well as parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. CR interneurons are known to disinhibit pyramidal neuron dendrites, whereas PV neurons provide strong perisomatic inhibition. This potentially counterintuitive connectivity, enabling amygdala to both enhance and inhibit CA3 activity, may provide a mechanism that can boost or suppress memory in an intensity-dependent way. To investigate this possibility, we simulated this connectivity pattern in a spiking network model. Our simulations revealed that moderate amygdala input can enrich CA3 representations of context through disinhibition via CR interneurons, but strong amygdalar input can impoverish CA3 activity through simultaneous excitation and feedforward inhibition via PV interneurons. Our model revealed an elegant circuit mechanism that mediates an affective “inverted U” phenomenon: There is an optimal level of amygdalar input that enriches hippocampal context representations, but on either side of this zone, representations are impoverished. This circuit mechanism helps explain why excessive emotional arousal can disrupt contextual memory and lead to overgeneralization, as seen in severe anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 07:00:56","2025-07-19 10:17:04","2667-2686","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\FE3HHTAF\John 等 - 2024 - Amygdalar Excitation of Hippocampal Interneurons Can Lead to Emotion-driven Overgeneralization of Co.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In laboratory settings, faces with fearful expressions have reliably evoked valence effects in inferior temporal cortex. However, because macaques use so called “fear grins” in a variety of different contexts, the deeper question is whether the macaque inferior temporal cortex is tuned to the prototypical fear grin, or to conspecifics signaling fear? In this study, we combined neuroimaging with the results of a behavioral task to investigate how macaques encode a wide variety of fearful facial expressions. In Experiment 1, we identified two sets of macaque face stimuli using different approaches; we selected faces based on the emotional context (i.e., calm vs. fearful), and we selected faces based on the engagement of action units (i.e., neutral vs. fear grins). We also included human faces in Experiment 1. Then, using fMRI, we found that the faces selected based on context elicited a larger valence effect in the inferior temporal cortex than faces selected based on visual appearance. Furthermore, human facial expressions only elicited weak valence effects. These observations were further supported by the results of a two-alternative, forced-choice task (Experiment 2), suggesting that fear grins vary in their perceived pleasantness. Collectively, these findings indicate that the macaque inferior temporal cortex is more involved in social intelligence than commonly assumed, encoding emergent properties in naturalistic face stimuli that transcend basic visual features. These results demand a rethinking of theories surrounding the function and operationalization of primate inferior temporal cortex.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 06:55:02","2025-07-19 10:17:14","2725-2741","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Real Face Value","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\2DSFK8K8\Taubert和Japee - 2024 - Real Face Value The Processing of Naturalistic Facial Expressions in the Macaque Inferior Temporal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Atypical development of these social skills has served as early marker of autism spectrum disorder and Williams syndrome. In this study, we trace the developmental trajectories of four neural networks underlying visual and attentional social engagement in the translational rhesus monkey model. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data and gaze following skills were collected in infant rhesus macaques from birth through 6 months of age. Developmental trajectories from subjects with both resting-state fMRI and eye-tracking data were used to explore brain–behavior relationships. Our findings indicate robust increases in functional connectivity (FC) between primary visual areas (primary visual cortex [V1] – extrastriate area 3 [V3] and V3 – middle temporal area [MT], MT and anterior superior temporal sulcus area [AST], as well as between anterior temporal area [TE]) and amygdala (AMY) as infants mature. Significant FC decreases were found in more rostral areas of the pathways, such as between temporal area occipital part – TE in the ventral object pathway, V3 – lateral intraparietal (LIP) of the dorsal visual attention pathway and V3 – temporo-parietal area of the ventral attention pathway. No changes in FC were found between cortical areas LIP-FEF and temporo-parietal area – Area 12 of the dorsal and ventral attention pathways or between Anterior Superior Temporal sulcus area (AST)-AMY and AMY-insula. Developmental trajectory of gaze following revealed a period of dynamic changes with gradual increases from 1 to 2 months, followed by slight decreases from 3 to 6 months. Exploratory association findings across the 6-month period showed that infants with higher gaze following had lower FC between primary visual areas V1–V3, but higher FC in the dorsal attention areas V3-LIP, both in the right hemisphere. Together, the first 6 months of life in rhesus macaques represent a critical period for the emergence of gaze following skills associated with maturational changes in FC of socially guided attention pathways.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 06:53:42","2025-07-19 10:17:17","2742-2760","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","The Development of Socially Directed Attention","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\DB4ZF4P3\Kovacs-Balint 等 - 2024 - The Development of Socially Directed Attention A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study in Inf.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, using fMRI, we measured the impact of each inactivation condition on responses in the other face patches relative to the control condition. In this study, we used the same method and measured the impact of each inactivation condition on responses in the FEF and the lateral intraparietal area, two regions associated with attentional processing, while face and nonface object stimuli were viewed. Our results revealed potential relationships between inferotemporal face patches and these two attention-related regions: The inactivation of the middle lateral and anterior fundal face patches had a pronounced impact on FEF, whereas the inactivation of the middle and anterior lateral face patches had a noticeable influence on LIP. Together, these initial exploratory findings document a circuit that potentially underlies the attentional capture of faces.

Although much is known about how we perceive expressions, the role of facial experience in shaping this remarkable ability remains unclear. Is our perception of expressions linked to how we ourselves make facial expressions? Are we better at recognizing other's facial expressions if we are experts at making the same expressions ourselves? And if we could not make facial expressions at all, would it impact our ability to recognize others' facial expressions? The current article aims to examine these questions by explicating the link between facial experience and facial expression recognition. It includes a comprehensive appraisal of the related literature and examines three main theories that posit a connection between making and recognizing facial expressions. First, recent studies in individuals with Moebius syndrome support the role of facial ability (i.e., the ability to move one's face to make facial expressions) in facial expression recognition. Second, motor simulation theory suggests that humans recognize others' facial expressions by covertly mimicking the observed expression (without overt motor action) and that this facial mimicry helps us identify and feel the associated emotion. Finally, the facial feedback hypothesis provides a framework for enhanced emotional experience via proprioceptive feedback from facial muscles when mimicking a viewed facial expression. Evidence for and against these theories is presented as well as some considerations and outstanding questions for future research studies investigating the role of facial experience in facial expression perception.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 06:52:38","2025-07-19 10:17:24","2780-2792","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\JNVP5K22\Japee - 2024 - On the Role of Sensorimotor Experience in Facial Expression Perception.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It remains unclear whether the oculomotor command of vergence eye movement would also influence visual processing. To address this question, we placed a light at 28.5 cm and a screen for stimulus presentation at 57 cm from the participants. In the NoDivergence condition, participants were asked to maintain fixation on the light regardless of stimulus presentation throughout the trial. In the WithDivergence condition, participants were instructed to initially maintain fixation on the near light and then turn their two eyes outward to look at the stimulus on the far screen. The stimulus was presented for 100 msec, entirely within the preparation stage of the divergence eye movement. We found that participants perceived the stimulus as larger but were less sensitive to stimulus sizes in the WithDivergence condition than in the NoDivergence condition. The earliest visual evoked component C1 (peak latency 80 msec), which varied with stimulus size in the NoDivergence condition, showed similar amplitudes for larger and smaller stimuli in the WithDivergence condition.

However, in the context of hippocampal-system dependent memories, a poor learning experience, memory for which would soon decay, can be enhanced if temporally paired with a “strong” memory triggering experience. The synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis explains this paradoxical enhancement by suggesting that only strong experiences generate cellular resources necessary for synaptic remodeling. However, synapses engaged in a “weak” learning experience can capture and utilize plasticity-related resources generated for a subsequent strong learning experience. Here, we tested whether such a “paradoxical” outcome would result in the context of motor (procedural) memory, if two movement sequences are unequally trained, consecutively. We show, in young adults (n = 100), that limited practice on a novel sequence of finger-to-thumb opposition movements led to different long-term outcomes, depending on whether and when (5 min, 5 hr) it was followed by extensive training on a different sequence. Five-minute pairing only resulted in overnight gains for the limited-trained sequence that were well-retained a week later; the overnight gains for the extensively trained sequence were compromised. Thus, consecutive training on different motor tasks can result in mnemonic interactions other than interference. We propose that the newly discovered mnemonic interaction provides the first-tier behavioral evidence in support of the possible applicability of notions stemming from the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis in relation to human motor memory generation, specifically in relation to the practice-dependent consolidation of novel explicitly instructed movement sequences.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 06:51:28","2025-07-19 10:17:28","2807-2821","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\DTMT6U7Q\Oren 等 - 2024 - Paradoxical Long-term Memory Augmentation following Temporal Pairing between “Limited” and “Extensiv.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this approach makes it difficult to determine which control processes are affected by reward. Does reward lead to improved performance via the inhibition of prepotent responses or the facilitation of goal-directed processing? Here, we use a forced-response paradigm to fix response initiation and systematically vary the time available for the cognitive processing necessary for response preparation.

However, this automaticity can come at the cost of reduced flexibility to adapt behavior when circumstances change. The goal-directed system is thought to counteract the habit system by providing the flexibility to pursue context-appropriate behaviors. The dichotomy between habitual action selection and flexible goal-directed behavior has recently been challenged by findings showing that rewards bias both action and goal selection. Here, we test whether reward reinforcement can give rise to habitual goal selection much as it gives rise to habitual action selection. We designed a rewarded, context-based perceptual discrimination task in which performance on one rule was reinforced. Using drift-diffusion models and psychometric analyses, we found that reward facilitates the initiation and execution of rules. Strikingly, we found that these biases persisted in a test phase in which rewards were no longer available. Although this facilitation is consistent with the habitual goal selection hypothesis, we did not find evidence that reward reinforcement reduced cognitive flexibility to implement alternative rules. Together, the findings suggest that reward creates a lasting impact on the selection and execution of goals but may not lead to the inflexibility characteristic of habits.

We sought to examine how mental effort and subjective experiences thereof interact as a function of the challenge level and the size of the incentives at stake. Participants performed a task that rewarded individual units of effort investment (correctly performed Stroop trials) but only if they met a threshold number of correct trials within a fixed time interval (challenge level). We varied this challenge level (Study 1, n = 40) and the rewards at stake (Study 2, n = 79) and measured variability in task performance and self-reported affect across task intervals. Greater challenge and higher rewards facilitated greater effort investment but also induced greater stress, whereas higher rewards (and lower challenge) simultaneously induced greater positive affect. Within intervals, we observed an initial speed up then slowdown in performance, which could reflect dynamic reconfiguration of control. Collectively, these findings further our understanding of the influence of task demands and incentives on mental effort exertion and well-being.","2024-12-01","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2025-09-12 06:48:56","2025-07-19 10:17:39","2863-2885","","12","36","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","Make or Break","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","Silverchair","","","","D:\soft\Zotero\保存目录\storage\WDUFT3BV\Zhang 等 - 2024 - Make or Break The Influence of Expected Challenges and Rewards on the Motivation and Experience Ass.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
