Yet research on whether social inequality may also be linked to brain structure and function has, until recently, been rare. Here we describe three methodological approaches that can be used to study this question—single site, single study; multi-site, single study; and spatial meta-analysis. We review empirical work that, using these approaches, has observed associations between neural outcomes and structural measures of social inequality—including structural stigma, community-level prejudice, gender inequality, neighbourhood disadvantage and the generosity of the social safety net for low-income families. We evaluate the relative strengths and limitations of these approaches, discuss ethical considerations and outline directions for future research. In doing so, we advocate for a paradigm shift in cognitive neuroscience that explicitly incorporates upstream structural and contextual factors, which we argue holds promise for uncovering the neural correlates of social inequality.","2024-01","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-08-17 09:59:08","20-31","","1","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Human behaviour; Cognitive neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests whether this transformation in production processes has been associated with disruptions in the longstanding labour market trend of increasing demand for interpersonal skills. To address this question, we integrate a skills taxonomy with the text of over 12 million Australian job postings to measure skills demand trends at the aggregate and occupational levels. We find that since the start of the pandemic, there has been an acceleration in the aggregate demand for interpersonal skills. We also find a strong positive association between an occupation’s propensity for remote work and the acceleration in interpersonal skills demand for the occupation.

Here we investigate whether human participants can gain volitional control of their arousal state using a pupil-based biofeedback approach. Our approach inverts a mechanism suggested by previous literature that links activity of the locus coeruleus, one of the key regulators of central arousal and pupil dynamics. We show that pupil-based biofeedback enables participants to acquire volitional control of pupil size. Applying pupil self-regulation systematically modulates activity of the locus coeruleus and other brainstem structures involved in arousal control. Furthermore, it modulates cardiovascular measures such as heart rate, and behavioural and psychophysiological responses during an oddball task. We provide evidence that pupil-based biofeedback makes the brain’s arousal system accessible to volitional control, a finding that has tremendous potential for translation to behavioural and clinical applications across various domains, including stress-related and anxiety disorders.","2024-01","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-08-17 09:59:15","43-62","","1","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Psychology; Autonomic nervous system; Cognitive control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine the impact of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization opinion, which overturned Roe v. Wade’s (1973) constitutional protection of abortion rights. A three-wave survey panel (5,489 interviews) conducted before the leak of the drafted Dobbs opinion, after the leak, and after the official opinion release, and cross-sectional data from these three time points (10,107 interviews) show that the ruling directly influenced views about the constitutional legality of abortion and fetal viability. However, personal opinions were not directly influenced and perceived social norms shifted away from the ruling, meaning that individuals perceived greater public support for abortion. We argue that extensive coverage of opposition to overturning Roe v. Wade supported this shift. Dobbs v.

In this prospectively registered umbrella review (PROSPERO identifier CRD42017076051), we harmonized effects from 102 meta-analyses (2,451 primary studies; 1,937,501 participants) of screen time and outcomes. In total, 43 effects from 32 meta-analyses met our criteria for statistical certainty. Meta-analyses of associations between screen use and outcomes showed small-to-moderate effects (range: r = –0.14 to 0.33). In education, results were mixed; for example, screen use was negatively associated with literacy (r = –0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) = –0.20 to –0.09, P ≤ 0.001, k = 38, N = 18,318), but this effect was positive when parents watched with their children (r = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.28, P = 0.028, k = 12, N = 6,083). In health, we found evidence for several small negative associations; for example, social media was associated with depression (r = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.19, P ≤ 0.001, k = 12, N = 93,740). Limitations of our review include the limited number of studies for each outcome, medium-to-high risk of bias in 95 out of 102 included meta-analyses and high heterogeneity (17 out of 22 in education and 20 out of 21 in health with I2 > 50%).

Here we report the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance/uptake and determinants among this vulnerable population of PLHIV based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published by 25 August 2023. Among the 54 included studies (N = 167,485 participants), 53 (N = 166,455) provided data on vaccine acceptance rate, while 27 (N = 150,926) provided uptake data. The global prevalences of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake were 67.0% and 56.6%, respectively. Acceptance and uptake rates were 86.6% and 90.1% for the European Region, 74.9% and 71.6% for the Region of the Americas, 62.3% and 78.9% for the South-East Asian Region, 64.6% and 19.3% for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 58.0% and 35.5% for the African Region, and 57.4% and 44.0% for the Western Pacific Region. The acceptance rate increased from 65.9% in 2020 to 71.0% in 2022, and the uptake rate increased from 55.9% in 2021 to 58.1% in 2022. Men, PLHIV aged ≥40 years and those who had recently received the influenza vaccine were more likely to accept and receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with lower uptake included Black race, other races (Latinx/Hispanic/mixed race), low education level and being unemployed. Vaccine-related factors associated with higher acceptance included belief in vaccine effectiveness, vaccine trust, perceived high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and fear of potential COVID-19 effect in PLHIV. Sustained efforts and targeted interventions are needed to reduce regional disparities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake among PLHIV.","2024-01","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-08-17 09:59:30","100-114","","1","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Epidemiology; Health policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here in a sample of 536 5-month-old same-sex twins, we assessed attention to faces using eye tracking in two ways: initial orienting to faces at the start of the trial (thought to reflect subcortical processing) and sustained face preference throughout the trial (thought to reflect emerging attention control). Twin model fitting suggested an influence of genetic and unique environmental effects, but there was no evidence for an effect of shared environment. The heritability of face orienting and preference were 0.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.33) and 0.46 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.57), respectively.

Here we present data collected in an online experiment where participants built personalized government programmes by combining policies proposed by the candidates of the 2022 French and Brazilian presidential elections. We use this data to explore aggregates complementing those used in social choice theory, finding that a metric of divisiveness, which is uncorrelated with traditional aggregation functions, can identify polarizing proposals. These metrics provide a score for the divisiveness of each proposal that can be estimated in the absence of data on the demographic characteristics of participants and that explains the issues that divide a population.

Here we aggregated genetic and neuroimaging data from 61,974 participants (age range, 9 to 98 years) in five cohorts to elucidate the genetic basis of ventricular morphology and examined their overlap with neuropsychiatric traits. Genome-wide association analysis in a discovery sample of 31,880 individuals identified 62 unique loci and 785 candidate genes associated with ventricular morphology. We replicated over 80% of loci in a well-matched cohort of lateral ventricular volume. Gene set analysis revealed enrichment of ventricular-trait-associated genes in biological processes and disease pathogenesis during both early brain development and degeneration. We explored the age-dependent genetic associations in cohorts of different age groups to investigate the possible roles of ventricular-trait-associated loci in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. We describe the genetic overlap between ventricular and neuropsychiatric traits through comprehensive integrative approaches under correlative and causal assumptions. We propose the volume of the inferior lateral ventricles as a heritable endophenotype to predict the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, which might be a consequence of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Our study provides an advance in understanding the genetics of the cerebral ventricles and demonstrates the potential utility of ventricular measurements in tracking brain disorders and maintaining brain health across the lifespan.","2024-01","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-08-17 09:59:52","164-180","","1","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Alzheimer's disease; Genetics of the nervous system; Genetics research; Genome-wide association studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A long-standing critique of latent factor theories is that the correlations used to infer latent factors can be produced by alternative data-generating mechanisms that do not include latent factors. This is referred to as the factor indeterminacy problem. Researchers have recently begun to overcome this problem by using information on the associations between individual genetic variants and measured variables.

In North Central Europe, stable isotopes and linear enamel hypoplasias indicate high environmental stress across sexes, but female stature is low, despite polygenic scores identical to males, and suggests that cultural factors preferentially supported male recovery from stress. In Mediterranean populations, sexual dimorphism is reduced, indicating male vulnerability to stress and no strong cultural preference for males.

Although robust research has studied the constituent components of social capital from the demand side (that is, the orientations people need for collective life in pluralistic societies, such as trust, cohesion and connectedness), the same precision has not been brought to the supply side. Here we define the concept of civic opportunity—opportunities people have to encounter civic experiences necessary for developing such orientations—and harness data science to map it across America. We demonstrate that civic opportunity is more highly correlated with pro-social outcomes such as mutual aid than other measures, but is unequally distributed, and its sources are underrepresented in the public dialogue.

We validate the model by reproducing key outcomes of the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the New York metropolitan area. The key mechanism coupling the epidemic and economic modules is the reduction in consumption due to fear of infection. In counterfactual experiments, we show that a similar trade-off between epidemic and economic outcomes exists both when individuals change their behaviour due to fear of infection and when non-pharmaceutical interventions are imposed. Low-income workers, who perform in-person occupations in customer-facing industries, face the strongest trade-off.","2024-02","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-08-17 10:03:27","264-275","","2","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01747-x.pdf","","Economics; Complex networks; Infectious diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In exploring mechanisms, we show that formality operates as a heuristic for credibility and importance. Recipients view the source of a formal letter as more competent and trustworthy, and view the request itself as more important to take action on, despite no evidence of change in comprehension or in perceived ease of taking action.

This paper reports an investigation by four coordinated laboratories of the prospective replicability of 16 novel experimental findings using rigour-enhancing practices: confirmatory tests, large sample sizes, preregistration and methodological transparency. In contrast to past systematic replication efforts that reported replication rates averaging 50%, replication attempts here produced the expected effects with significance testing (P < 0.05) in 86% of attempts, slightly exceeding the maximum expected replicability based on observed effect sizes and sample sizes. When one lab attempted to replicate an effect discovered by another lab, the effect size in the replications was 97% that in the original study. This high replication rate justifies confidence in rigour-enhancing methods to increase the replicability of new discoveries.","2024-02","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-08-17 10:03:44","311-319","","2","8","","Nat Hum Behav","RETRACTED ARTICLE","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01749-9.pdf","","Psychology; Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we propose a framework for three-dimensional shape perception that explains perception in both typical and atypical cases as analysis-by-synthesis, or inference in a generative model of image formation. The model integrates intuitive physics to explain how shape can be inferred from the deformations it causes to other objects, as in cloth draping. Behavioural and computational studies comparing this account with several alternatives show that it best matches human observers (total n = 174) in both accuracy and response times, and is the only model that correlates significantly with human performance on difficult discriminations.

Here we combined eye-tracking with representational geometry analyses to uncover the information in miniature gaze patterns while participants (n = 41) were cued to maintain visual object orientations. Although participants were discouraged from breaking fixation by means of real-time feedback, small gaze shifts (<1°) robustly encoded the to-be-maintained stimulus orientation, with evidence for encoding two sequentially presented orientations at the same time. The orientation encoding on stimulus presentation was object-specific, but it changed to a more object-independent format during cued maintenance, particularly when attention had been temporarily withdrawn from the memorandum. Finally, categorical reporting biases increased after unattended storage, with indications of biased gaze geometries already emerging during the maintenance periods before behavioural reporting. These findings disclose a wealth of information in gaze patterns during visuospatial working memory and indicate systematic changes in representational format when memory contents have been unattended.","2024-02","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-09-03 20:44:51","2025-08-17 10:03:54","336-348","","2","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01737-z.pdf","","Human behaviour; Cognitive neuroscience; Learning and memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fMRI analysis the intensity of the signal serves as a proxy for the intensity of local neuronal activity, but changes in either the intensity or the duration of neuronal activity can yield identical fMRI signals. Therefore, if RTs are ignored and pair with neuronal durations, fMRI results claiming intensity differences may be confounded by RTs. We show how ignoring RTs goes beyond this confound, where longer RTs are paired with larger activation estimates, to lesser-known issues where RTs become confounds in group-level analyses and, surprisingly, how the RT confound can induce other artificial group-level associations with variables that are not related to the condition contrast or RTs.

While exposure to disinformation had strong detrimental effects on participants’ climate change beliefs (δ = −0.16), affect towards climate mitigation action (δ = −0.33), ability to detect disinformation (δ = −0.14) and pro-environmental behaviour (δ = −0.24), we found almost no evidence for protective effects of the inoculations (all δ < 0.20).

Sleep need varies over time and differs between individuals, showing a complex relationship with neurocognitive function.

Our findings show that the median resident makes only 14% of daily consumption trips locally.

Specifically, across multiple contexts, using both experimental methods (four studies, total n = 1,801) and analyses of archival data, we find that there is more variability in judgements of the value of more novel (versus less novel) ideas. We also find that people interpret greater variability in others’ judgements about an idea’s value as a signal of risk, reducing their willingness to invest in the idea.

TD-CBT had larger effects on depression (g = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.57–0.92, P < 0.001) and anxiety (g = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.56–0.97, P < 0.001) than did controls. Across treatment formats, TD-CBT was superior to waitlist and treatment-as-usual. TD-CBT showed comparable effects to disorder-specific CBT and was superior to other active treatments for depression but not for anxiety. Different treatment formats showed comparable effects. TD-CBT was superior to controls at 3, 6 and 12 months but not at 24 months follow-up. Studies were heterogeneous in design and methodological quality.

Simulations show effects of memory age and hippocampal lesions in agreement with previous models, but also provide mechanisms for semantic memory, imagination, episodic future thinking, relational inference and schema-based distortions including boundary extension. The model explains how unique sensory and predictable conceptual elements of memories are stored and reconstructed by efficiently combining both hippocampal and neocortical systems, optimizing the use of limited hippocampal storage for new and unusual information.

Second, we show that this language information density is associated with a denser configuration of semantic information. Finally, we trace the relationship between language information density and patterns of communication, showing that informationally denser languages tend towards faster communication but conceptually narrower conversations or expositions within which topics are discussed at greater depth.

This study investigates consumption responses to the CTC expansion using anonymized mobile-location data and debit/credit card data that track visits and spending at 1.3 million establishments across US counties. For identification, we exploit variation in the size of households’ income gains due to the CTC across counties in a difference-in-differences framework spanning January 2021 to May 2022. Counties benefiting most from the CTC expansion experienced larger increases in visits to childcare centres and health- and personal-care establishments, and increased visits to and spending per transaction at grocery and general stores.

Here we systematically analyse the relationships between several models and datasets using machine-learning methods and find evidence for dataset bias. Because participants’ choices in stochastically dominated gambles were consistently skewed towards equipreference in the choices13k dataset, we hypothesized that this reflected increased decision noise. Indeed, a probabilistic generative model adding structured decision noise to a neural network trained on data from a laboratory study transferred best, that is, outperformed all models apart from those trained on choices13k.

In this Article, we show that Bayesian optimality and wishful thinking are, despite first appearances, compatible. The setting of opposing goals can cause two groups of people with identical prior beliefs to reach opposite conclusions about the same evidence through fully Bayesian calculations. We show that this is possible because, when people set goals, they receive privileged information in the form of affective experiences, and this information systematically supports goal-consistent conclusions.

Deep neural networks that are trained either on images or on text or by pairing images and text enable us now to disentangle human mental representations into their visual, visual–semantic and semantic components. Here we used these deep neural networks to uncover the content of human mental representations of familiar faces and objects when they are viewed or recalled from memory. The results show a larger visual than semantic contribution when images are viewed and a reversed pattern when they are recalled.

Here, we obtained subsecond estimates of dopamine and serotonin from human substantia nigra pars reticulata during the ultimatum game. Participants, who were patients with Parkinson’s disease undergoing awake brain surgery, had to accept or reject monetary offers of varying fairness from human and computer players. They rejected more offers in the human than the computer condition, an effect of social context associated with higher overall levels of dopamine but not serotonin. Regardless of the social context, relative changes in dopamine tracked trial-by-trial changes in offer value—akin to reward prediction errors—whereas serotonin tracked the current offer value.

Despite decades of behavioural and imaging studies, it is unknown how the specific activity patterns and temporal dynamics in motor cortex during covert motor imagery relate to those during motor execution. Here we recorded intracortical activity from the motor cortex of two people who retain some residual wrist function following incomplete spinal cord injury as they performed both actual and imagined isometric wrist extensions. We found that we could decompose the population activity into three orthogonal subspaces, where one was similarly active during both action and imagery, and the others were active only during a single task type—action or imagery. Although they inhabited orthogonal neural dimensions, the action-unique and imagery-unique subspaces contained a strikingly similar set of dynamic features.

It has been suggested that attention is regulated by the ongoing phase of slow excitability fluctuations of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex, a hypothesis that has been challenged with no consensus. Here we developed a behavioural and non-invasive stimulation paradigm aiming at modulating slow excitability fluctuations of the inferior frontal junction. Using this approach, we show that non-spatial attention can be selectively modulated as a function of the ongoing phase of exogenously modulated excitability states of this brain structure. These results demonstrate that non-spatial attention relies on ongoing prefrontal excitability states, which are probably regulated by slow oscillatory dynamics, that orchestrate goal-oriented behaviour.","2024-04","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:10:34","743-757","","4","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01820-z.pdf","","Human behaviour; Cognitive neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analysed indirect genetic effects on children’s academic achievement in their fifth to ninth years of schooling in N = 37,117 parent–offspring trios in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). We used pairs of genetically related families (parents were siblings, children were cousins; N = 10,913) to distinguish within-nuclear-family genetic-nurture effects from dynastic effects shared by cousins in different nuclear families.

Here we conducted multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using hypothalamic imaging data from 32,956 individuals to uncover the genetic underpinnings of the hypothalamus and its involvement in neuropsychiatric traits. There were 23 significant loci associated with the whole hypothalamus and its subunits, with functional enrichment for genes involved in intracellular trafficking systems and metabolic processes of steroid-related compounds. The hypothalamus exhibited substantial genetic associations with limbic system structures and neuropsychiatric traits including chronotype, risky behaviour, cognition, satiety and sympathetic–parasympathetic activity. The strongest signal in the primary GWAS, the ADAMTS8 locus, was replicated in three independent datasets (N = 1,685–4,321) and was strengthened after meta-analysis. Exome-wide association analyses added evidence to the association for ADAMTS8, and Mendelian randomization showed lower ADAMTS8 expression with larger hypothalamic volumes. The current study advances our understanding of complex structure–function relationships of the hypothalamus and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie hypothalamic formation.","2024-04","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:10:49","779-793","","4","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01792-6.pdf","","Genetics of the nervous system; Genetics research; Genome-wide association studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here I present two experiments (n = 671 and n = 406), including one based on a highly visceral transaction (eating insects). Incentives caused biased information search—participants offered a higher incentive to comply more often sought encouragement to do so. However, I demonstrate theoretically that such behaviour does not prove that incentives have harmful effects; it is consistent with Bayesian rationality. Empirically, although a substantial minority of participants made bad decisions, incentives did not magnify them in a way that would suggest allowing a transaction but capping incentives.

We measured a signature of mental representations of rhythm in 39 participant groups in 15 countries, spanning urban societies and Indigenous populations. Listeners reproduced random ‘seed’ rhythms; their reproductions were fed back as the stimulus (as in the game of ‘telephone’), such that their biases (the prior) could be estimated from the distribution of reproductions. Every tested group showed a sparse prior with peaks at integer-ratio rhythms. However, the importance of different integer ratios varied across groups, often reflecting local musical practices. Our results suggest a common feature of music cognition: discrete rhythm ‘categories’ at small-integer ratios. These discrete representations plausibly stabilize musical systems in the face of cultural transmission but interact with culture-specific traditions to yield the diversity that is evident when mental representations are probed across many cultures.","2024-05","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:13:18","846-877","","5","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01800-9.pdf","","Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite repeated exposure to COVID-19 vaccination messaging in our population, reminders and psychological ownership language increased booster uptake, replicating prior findings.

One plausible condition for cumulative cultural evolution to emerge is individuals’ ability to use social learning to acquire know-how that they cannot easily innovate by themselves. It has been suggested that chimpanzees may be capable of such know-how social learning, but this assertion remains largely untested. Here we show that chimpanzees use social learning to acquire a skill that they failed to independently innovate. By teaching chimpanzees how to solve a sequential task (one chimpanzee in each of the two tested groups, n = 66) and using network-based diffusion analysis, we found that 14 naive chimpanzees learned to operate a puzzle box that they failed to operate during the preceding three months of exposure to all necessary materials. In conjunction, we present evidence for the hypothesis that social learning in chimpanzees is necessary and sufficient to acquire a new, complex skill after the initial innovation.","2024-05","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:13:24","891-902","","5","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01836-5.pdf","","Biological anthropology; Animal behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An individual’s computational phenotype is defined as a set of mechanistically interpretable parameters obtained from fitting computational models to behavioural data. However, the interpretation of these parameters hinges critically on their psychometric properties, which are rarely studied. To identify the sources governing the temporal variability of the computational phenotype, we carried out a 12-week longitudinal study using a battery of seven tasks that measure aspects of human learning, memory, perception and decision making. To examine the influence of state effects, each week, participants provided reports tracking their mood, habits and daily activities. We developed a dynamic computational phenotyping framework, which allowed us to tease apart the time-varying effects of practice and internal states such as affective valence and arousal. Our results show that many phenotype dimensions covary with practice and affective factors, indicating that what appears to be unreliability may reflect previously unmeasured structure. These results support a fundamentally dynamic understanding of cognitive variability within an individual.","2024-05","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:13:33","917-931","","5","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01814-x.pdf","","Human behaviour; Cognitive neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we conducted a multivariate analysis on human intracranial signals covering most brain regions and successfully dissociated distractor-specific representations from target-arousal signals in the high-frequency (60–100 Hz) activity. We found that salient distractors were processed rapidly around 220 ms, while target-tuning attention was attenuated simultaneously, supporting initial capture by distractors. Notably, neuronal activity specific to the distractor representation was strongest in the superior and middle temporal gyrus, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, while there were smaller contributions from the parietal and frontal cortices.

We hypothesized that the brain implements multivariate control by independently monitoring feature-specific difficulty and independently prioritizing feature-specific processing. During functional MRI, participants performed a parametric conflict task that separately tags target and distractor processing. Consistent with feature-specific monitoring, univariate analyses revealed spatially segregated encoding of target and distractor difficulty in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Consistent with feature-specific attentional priority, our encoding geometry analysis revealed overlapping but orthogonal representations of target and distractor coherence in the intraparietal sulcus.

However, its neural bases remain unclear. Here we address this gap by systematically identifying and quantitatively synthesizing neuroanatomical studies of DLD using co-localization likelihood estimation, a recently developed neuroanatomical meta-analytic technique. Analyses of structural brain data (22 peer-reviewed papers, 577 participants) revealed highly consistent anomalies only in the basal ganglia (100% of participant groups in which this structure was examined, weighted by group sample sizes; 99.8% permutation-based likelihood the anomaly clustering was not due to chance). These anomalies were localized specifically to the anterior neostriatum (again 100% weighted proportion and 99.8% likelihood). As expected given the task dependence of activation, functional neuroimaging data (11 peer-reviewed papers, 414 participants) yielded less consistency, though anomalies again occurred primarily in the basal ganglia (79.0% and 95.1%). Multiple sensitivity analyses indicated that the patterns were robust. The meta-analyses elucidate the neuroanatomical signature of DLD, and implicate the basal ganglia in particular. The findings support the procedural circuit deficit hypothesis of DLD, have basic research and translational implications for the disorder, and advance our understanding of the neuroanatomy of language.","2024-05","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:13:46","962-975","","5","8","","Nat Hum Behav","The neuroanatomy of developmental language disorder","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01843-6.pdf","","Language; Neurodevelopmental disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New experimental tools have revealed that observers possess richer information about the uncertainty in their memories and take advantage of environmental regularities to use limited memory resources optimally.

We describe the advantages and drawbacks of using games relative to standard laboratory-based experiments and lay out a set of recommendations on how to gain the most from using games to study cognition.

However, recent work has argued that highly clustered, rather than random, networks facilitate the spread of threshold-based contagions, such as those motivated by myopic best response for adoption of new innovations, norms and products in games of strategic complement. Here we show that minor modifications to this model reverse this result, thereby harmonizing qualitative facts about how network structure affects contagion. We analyse the rate of spread over circular lattices with rewired edges and show that having a small probability of adoption below the threshold probability is enough to ensure that random rewiring accelerates the spread of a noisy threshold-based contagion. This conclusion is verified in simulations of empirical networks and remains valid with partial but frequent enough rewiring and when adoption decisions are reversible but infrequently so, as well as in high-dimensional lattice structures.","2024-06","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:17:27","1057-1064","","6","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01865-0.pdf","","Complex networks; Sociology; Applied mathematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A promising evolutionary explanation of these features is the endurance pursuit (EP) hypothesis, which argues that both traits evolved to facilitate running down game by persistence. However, this hypothesis has faced two challenges: running is energetically costly and accounts of EPs among late twentieth century foragers are rare. While both observations appear to suggest that EPs would be ineffective, we use foraging theory to demonstrate that EPs can be quite efficient. We likewise analyse an ethnohistoric and ethnographic database of nearly 400 EP cases representing 272 globally distributed locations. We provide estimates for return rates of EPs and argue that these are comparable to other pre-modern hunting methods in specified contexts.

Using UK Biobank data, three cohorts were constructed: SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 26,101), contemporary control with no evidence of infection (n = 380,337) and historical control predating the pandemic (n = 390,621). Compared with contemporary controls, infected participants had higher subsequent risks of incident mental health at 1 year (hazard ratio (HR): 1.54, 95% CI 1.42–1.67; P = 1.70 × 10−24; difference in incidence rate: 27.36, 95% CI 21.16–34.10 per 1,000 person-years), including psychotic, mood, anxiety, alcohol use and sleep disorders, and prescriptions for antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers and opioids.

Included studies always featured a touch versus no touch control intervention with diverse health outcomes as dependent variables. Risk of bias was assessed via small study, randomization, sequencing, performance and attrition bias. Touch interventions were especially effective in regulating cortisol levels (Hedges’ g = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.31) and increasing weight (0.65, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.94) in newborns as well as in reducing pain (0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.89), feelings of depression (0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78) and state (0.64, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.84) or trait anxiety (0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77) for adults.

The untested assumption is that biomimetic motor control enhances device embodiment, learning, generalization and automaticity. To test this, we compared biomimetic and non-biomimetic control strategies for non-disabled participants when learning to control a wearable myoelectric bionic hand operated by an eight-channel electromyography pattern-recognition system. We compared motor learning across days and behavioural tasks for two training groups: biomimetic (mimicking the desired bionic hand gesture with biological hand) and arbitrary control (mapping an unrelated biological hand gesture with the desired bionic gesture). For both trained groups, training improved bionic limb control, reduced cognitive reliance and increased embodiment over the bionic hand. Biomimetic users had more intuitive and faster control early in training. Arbitrary users matched biomimetic performance later in training. Furthermore, arbitrary users showed increased generalization to a new control strategy. Collectively, our findings suggest that biomimetic and arbitrary control strategies provide different benefits. The optimal strategy is probably not strictly biomimetic, but rather a flexible strategy within the biomimetic-to-arbitrary spectrum, depending on the user, available training opportunities and user requirements.","2024-06","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:17:42","1108-1123","","6","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01811-6.pdf","","Brain–machine interface; Biomedical engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One potential mechanism for this coordination is a travelling wave, in which a neural oscillation propagates across the brain while organizing the order and timing of activity across regions. Although travelling waves are present across the brain in various species, their potential functional relevance has remained unknown. Here, using rare direct human brain recordings, we demonstrate a distinct functional role for travelling waves of theta- and alpha-band (2–13 Hz) oscillations in the cortex. Travelling waves propagate in different directions during separate cognitive processes. In episodic memory, travelling waves tended to propagate in a posterior-to-anterior direction during successful memory encoding and in an anterior-to-posterior direction during recall. Because travelling waves of oscillations correspond to local neuronal spiking, these patterns indicate that rhythmic pulses of activity move across the brain in different directions for separate behaviours. More broadly, our results suggest a fundamental role for travelling waves and oscillations in dynamically coordinating neural connectivity, by flexibly organizing the timing and directionality of network interactions across the cortex to support cognition and behaviour.","2024-06","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:17:46","1124-1135","","6","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01838-3.pdf","","Cortex; Short-term memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While important advances in vocalized, attempted and mimed speech decoding have been achieved, results for internal speech decoding are sparse and have yet to achieve high functionality. Notably, it is still unclear from which brain areas internal speech can be decoded. Here two participants with tetraplegia with implanted microelectrode arrays located in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) performed internal and vocalized speech of six words and two pseudowords. In both participants, we found significant neural representation of internal and vocalized speech, at the single neuron and population level in the SMG. From recorded population activity in the SMG, the internally spoken and vocalized words were significantly decodable. In an offline analysis, we achieved average decoding accuracies of 55% and 24% for each participant, respectively (chance level 12.5%), and during an online internal speech BMI task, we averaged 79% and 23% accuracy, respectively. Evidence of shared neural representations between internal speech, word reading and vocalized speech processes was found in participant 1. SMG represented words as well as pseudowords, providing evidence for phonetic encoding. Furthermore, our decoder achieved high classification with multiple internal speech strategies (auditory imagination/visual imagination). Activity in S1 was modulated by vocalized but not internal speech in both participants, suggesting no articulator movements of the vocal tract occurred during internal speech production. This work represents a proof-of-concept for a high-performance internal speech BMI.","2024-06","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-09-03 20:44:53","2025-08-17 10:17:50","1136-1149","","6","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01867-y.pdf","","Language; Brain–machine interface; Neural decoding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect is accompanied by reorganizations of ensemble activity patterns in the posterior piriform cortex that parallel subjective odour quality changes, in addition to substructure-based neural adaptations in the anterior piriform cortex and amygdala.

These capabilities make VR a powerful tool for many types of behavioural research, including studies of sensorimotor, perceptual and cognitive functions. Here we introduce Ouvrai, an open-source solution that facilitates the design and execution of remote VR studies, capitalizing on the surge in VR headset ownership. This tool allows researchers to develop sophisticated experiments using cutting-edge web technologies such as WebXR to enable browser-based VR, without compromising on experimental design. Ouvrai’s features include easy installation, intuitive JavaScript templates, a component library managing front- and backend processes and a streamlined workflow. It integrates with Firebase, Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk and provides data processing utilities for analysis.

However, Central African hunter-gatherers (CAHGs) currently speak languages acquired from their neighbouring farmers. Hence it remains unclear which aspects of CAHG cultural diversity results from long-term evolution preceding agriculture and which reflect borrowing from farmers. On the basis of musical instruments, foraging tools, specialized vocabulary and genome-wide data from ten CAHG populations, we reveal evidence of large-scale cultural interconnectivity among CAHGs before and after the Bantu expansion. We also show that the distribution of hunter-gatherer musical instruments correlates with the oldest genomic segments in our sample predating farming. Music-related words are widely shared between western and eastern groups and likely precede the borrowing of Bantu languages. In contrast, subsistence tools are less frequently exchanged and may result from adaptation to local ecologies.

Nurses could provide non-emergent transportation to a health centre, recommend self-care or return callers to the traditional 911 system. Over about one year, 6,053 callers were randomized (1:1) to receive a business-as-usual response (ncontrol = 3,023) or further triage (ntreatment = 3,030). We report on seven of nine outcomes, which were pre-registered (https://osf.io/xderw). The proportion of calls resulting in an ambulance dispatch dropped from 97% to 56% (β = −1.216 (−1.324, −1.108), P < 0.001), and those resulting in an ambulance transport dropped from 73% to 45% (β = −3.376 (−3.615, −3.137), P < 0.001). Among those callers who were Medicaid beneficiaries, within 24 hours, the proportion of calls resulting in an emergency department visit for issues classified as non-emergent or primary care physician (PCP) treatable dropped from 29.5% to 25.1% (β = −0.230 (−0.391, −0.069), P < 0.001), and the proportion resulting in the caller visiting a PCP rose from 2.5% to 8.2% (β = 1.252 (0.889, 1.615), P < 0.001). Over the longer time span of six months, we failed to detect evidence of impacts on emergency department visits, PCP visits or Medicaid expenditures. From a safety perspective, 13 callers randomized to treatment were eventually diagnosed with a time-sensitive illness, all of whom were quickly triaged to an ambulance response. These short-term effects suggest that nurse-led triage of non-emergent calls can safely connect callers to more appropriate, timely care.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:21:32","1276-1284","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01889-6.pdf","","Health policy; Social policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent development of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has led to intense debate about the possibility that these models exhibit behaviour that is indistinguishable from human behaviour in theory of mind tasks. Here we compare human and LLM performance on a comprehensive battery of measurements that aim to measure different theory of mind abilities, from understanding false beliefs to interpreting indirect requests and recognizing irony and faux pas. We tested two families of LLMs (GPT and LLaMA2) repeatedly against these measures and compared their performance with those from a sample of 1,907 human participants. Across the battery of theory of mind tests, we found that GPT-4 models performed at, or even sometimes above, human levels at identifying indirect requests, false beliefs and misdirection, but struggled with detecting faux pas. Faux pas, however, was the only test where LLaMA2 outperformed humans. Follow-up manipulations of the belief likelihood revealed that the superiority of LLaMA2 was illusory, possibly reflecting a bias towards attributing ignorance. By contrast, the poor performance of GPT originated from a hyperconservative approach towards committing to conclusions rather than from a genuine failure of inference. These findings not only demonstrate that LLMs exhibit behaviour that is consistent with the outputs of mentalistic inference in humans but also highlight the importance of systematic testing to ensure a non-superficial comparison between human and artificial intelligences.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:21:35","1285-1295","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01882-z.pdf","","Technology; Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some visual stimuli are also known to linger for longer in memory. Yet, whether these two features of visual processing are linked is unknown. Despite early assumptions that time is an extracted or higher-order feature of perception, more recent work over the past two decades has demonstrated that timing may be instantiated within sensory modality circuits. A primary location for many of these studies is the visual system, where duration-sensitive responses have been demonstrated. Furthermore, visual stimulus features have been observed to shift perceived duration. These findings suggest that visual circuits mediate or construct perceived time. Here we present evidence across a series of experiments that perceived time is affected by the image properties of scene size, clutter and memorability. More specifically, we observe that scene size and memorability dilate time, whereas clutter contracts it. Furthermore, the durations of more memorable images are also perceived more precisely. Conversely, the longer the perceived duration of an image, the more memorable it is. To explain these findings, we applied a recurrent convolutional neural network model of the ventral visual system, in which images are progressively processed over time. We find that more memorable images are processed faster, and that this increase in processing speed predicts both the lengthening and the increased precision of perceived durations. These findings provide evidence for a link between image features, time perception and memory that can be further explored with models of visual processing.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:21:39","1296-1308","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01863-2.pdf","","Human behaviour; Sensory processing; Pattern vision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This raises a foundational question about the architecture of the mind: how does perception interface with and influence memory? Here, inspired by a classic proposal relating perceptual processing to memory durability, the level-of-processing theory, we present a sparse coding model for compressing feature embeddings of images, and show that the reconstruction residuals from this model predict how well images are encoded into memory. In an open memorability dataset of scene images, we show that reconstruction error not only explains memory accuracy, but also response latencies during retrieval, subsuming, in the latter case, all of the variance explained by powerful vision-only models. We also confirm a prediction of this account with ‘model-driven psychophysics’. This work establishes reconstruction error as an important signal interfacing perception and memory, possibly through adaptive modulation of perceptual processing.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:21:42","1309-1320","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01870-3.pdf","","Human behaviour; Learning and memory; Computational neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, to study what caused this brain expansion, I mathematically model the evolutionary and developmental (evo-devo) dynamics of hominin brain size. The model recovers (1) the evolution of brain and body sizes of seven hominin species starting from brain and body sizes of the australopithecine scale, (2) the evolution of the hominin brain–body allometry and (3) major patterns of human development and evolution. I show that the brain expansion recovered is not caused by direct selection for brain size but by its genetic correlation with developmentally late preovulatory ovarian follicles. This correlation is generated over development if individuals experience a challenging ecology and seemingly cumulative culture, among other conditions. These findings show that the evolution of exceptionally adaptive traits may not be primarily caused by selection for them but by developmental constraints that divert selection.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:21:47","1321-1333","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01887-8.pdf","","Biological anthropology; Evolutionary developmental biology; Evolutionary theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, given that veridical head-direction signals require physical rotation of the head and most human neuroimaging experiments depend upon fixing the head in position, little is known about how the human brain is tuned to such heading signals. Here we adress this by asking 52 healthy participants undergoing simultaneous electroencephalography and motion tracking recordings (split into two experiments) and 10 patients undergoing simultaneous intracranial electroencephalography and motion tracking recordings to complete a series of orientation tasks in which they made physical head rotations to target positions. We then used a series of forward encoding models and linear mixed-effects models to isolate electrophysiological activity that was specifically tuned to heading direction. We identified a robust posterior central signature that predicts changes in veridical head orientation after regressing out confounds including sensory input and muscular activity. Both source localization and intracranial analysis implicated the medial temporal lobe as the origin of this effect. Subsequent analyses disentangled head-direction signatures from signals relating to head rotation and those reflecting location-specific effects. Lastly, when directly comparing head direction and eye-gaze-related tuning, we found that the brain maintains both codes while actively navigating, with stronger tuning to head direction in the medial temporal lobe. Together, these results reveal a taxonomy of population-level head-direction signals within the human brain that is reminiscent of those reported in the single units of rodents.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:21:52","1334-1350","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01872-1.pdf","","Navigation; Neural circuits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, using functional MRI (n = 30) and lesion patient (n = 26) studies, we argue that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) drives goal commitment linked to changes in goal-directed selective attention. Participants performed an incremental goal pursuit task involving sequential decisions between persisting with a goal versus abandoning progress for better alternative options. Individuals with stronger goal perseveration showed higher goal-directed attention in an interleaved attention task. Increasing goal-directed attention also affected abandonment decisions: while pursuing a goal, people lost their sensitivity to valuable alternative goals while remaining more sensitive to changes in the current goal. In a healthy population, individual differences in both commitment biases and goal-oriented attention were predicted by baseline goal-related activity in the vmPFC. Among lesion patients, vmPFC damage reduced goal commitment, leading to a performance benefit.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:21:56","1351-1365","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01844-5.pdf","","Human behaviour; Decision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of its prospective and inferential functions, we hypothesized that it might be required specifically when decisions involve the evaluation of uncertain values. A group of individuals with autoimmune limbic encephalitis—a condition known to focally affect the hippocampus—were tested on how they evaluate reward against uncertainty compared to reward against another key attribute: physical effort. Across four experiments requiring participants to make trade-offs between reward, uncertainty and effort, patients with acute limbic encephalitis demonstrated blunted sensitivity to reward and effort whenever uncertainty was considered, despite demonstrating intact uncertainty sensitivity. By contrast, the valuation of these two attributes (reward and effort) was intact on uncertainty-free tasks. Reduced sensitivity to changes in reward under uncertainty correlated with the severity of hippocampal damage. Together, these findings provide evidence for a context-sensitive role of the hippocampus in value-based decision-making, apparent specifically under conditions of uncertainty.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:21:59","1366-1382","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01855-2.pdf","","Human behaviour; Decision; Neurology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, in a series of studies, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with machine-learning-based predictive modelling to establish a comprehensive neurobiological model of subjective disgust. The developed neurofunctional signature accurately predicted momentary self-reported subjective disgust across discovery (n = 78) and pre-registered validation (n = 30) cohorts and generalized across core disgust (n = 34 and n = 26), gustatory distaste (n = 30) and socio-moral (unfair offers; n = 43) contexts. Disgust experience was encoded in distributed cortical and subcortical systems, and exhibited distinct and shared neural representations with subjective fear or negative affect in interoceptive-emotional awareness and conscious appraisal systems, while the signatures most accurately predicted the respective target experience.

Patients with rare focal vmPFC lesions (n = 25), patients with lesions elsewhere (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 40) chose between rest and exerting effort to earn rewards for themselves or another person. vmPFC damage decreased prosociality across behavioural and computational measures. vmPFC patients earned less, discounted rewards by effort more, and exerted less force when another person benefited, compared to both control groups. Voxel-based lesion mapping revealed dissociations between vmPFC subregions.

However, the causal relationships between brain resting-state functional networks and psychiatric disorders remain largely unclear. Here we perform bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to investigate the causalities between 191 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) phenotypes (n = 34,691 individuals) and 12 psychiatric disorders (n = 14,307 to 698,672 individuals). Forward MR identified 8 rsfMRI phenotypes causally associated with the risk of psychiatric disorders. For example, the increase in the connectivity of motor, subcortical-cerebellum and limbic network was associated with lower risk of autism spectrum disorder. In adddition, increased connectivity in the default mode and central executive network was associated with lower risk of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Reverse MR analysis revealed significant associations between 4 psychiatric disorders and 6 rsfMRI phenotypes. For instance, the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder increases the connectivity of the attention, salience, motor and subcortical-cerebellum network. The risk of schizophrenia mainly increases the connectivity of the default mode and central executive network and decreases the connectivity of the attention network. In summary, our findings reveal causal relationships between brain functional networks and psychiatric disorders, providing important interventional and therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders at the brain functional network level.","2024-07","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:22:13","1417-1428","","7","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01879-8.pdf","","Genomics; Psychiatric disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenges include our ambiguous causal language and thinking, statistical under- or over-control, effect heterogeneity, interference, timescales of effects and complex treatments. We explain how methods optimized for addressing one of these challenges frequently exacerbate other problems. We thus argue that clearly specified research questions are key to improving causal inference from data. We suggest a triangulation approach that compares causal estimates from (quasi-)experimental research with causal estimates generated from observational data and theoretical assumptions.

Often referred to as ‘early Celtic’, suggesting tentative connections to later cultural phenomena, its societal and population structure remain enigmatic. Here we present genomic and isotope data from 31 individuals from this context in southern Germany, dating between 616 and 200 BCE. We identify multiple biologically related groups spanning three elite burials as far as 100 km apart, supported by trans-regional individual mobility inferred from isotope data. These include a close biological relationship between two of the richest burial mounds of the Hallstatt culture. Bayesian modelling points to an avuncular relationship between the two individuals, which may suggest a practice of matrilineal dynastic succession in early Celtic elites. We show that their ancestry is shared on a broad geographic scale from Iberia throughout Central-Eastern Europe, undergoing a decline after the late Iron Age (450 BCE to ~50 CE).","2024-08","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:25:28","1467-1480","","8","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01888-7.pdf","","History; Archaeology; Biological anthropology; Population genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results suggest that over the January 1997 to December 2019 period, zoonotic disease was negatively associated with state initiation of civil conflict and positively associated with social conflict involving identity militias.

We examined how exposure to fact-checking, media literacy tips and media coverage of misinformation affects individuals’ perception of both factual and false information, as well as their trust in key democratic institutions.

Our findings show that context sensitivity was present in all 11 countries. Suboptimal decisions generated by context manipulation were not explained by risk aversion, as estimated through a separate description-based choice task (that is, lotteries) consisting of matched decision offers. Conversely, risk aversion significantly differed across countries.

Here, we show that fMRI-based estimates of functional brain connectivity artifactually inflate at spatially heterogeneous rates during resting-state and task-based scans. This produces false positive connection strength changes and spatial distortion of brain connectivity maps. We demonstrate that this artefact is driven by temporal inflation of the non-neuronal, systemic low-frequency oscillation (sLFO) blood flow signal during fMRI scanning and is not addressed by standard denoising procedures. We provide evidence that sLFO inflation reflects perturbations in cerebral blood flow by respiration and heart rate changes that accompany diminishing arousal during scanning, although the mechanisms of this pathway are uncertain. Finally, we show that adding a specialized sLFO denoising procedure to fMRI processing pipelines mitigates the artifactual inflation of functional connectivity, enhancing the validity and within-scan reliability of fMRI findings.","2024-08","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-09-03 20:44:54","2025-08-17 10:26:18","1568-1580","","8","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01908-6.pdf","","Neural circuits; Functional magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We go on to demonstrate the power of this approach to clarify genetic signal, enhance discovery and identify associations between underlying phenotypic structure and health outcomes.

However, the extent to which these effects are direct or indirect and whether genetic risk moderates them is unclear. We examined associations among ACEs, mood/anxiety disorders and substance dependence in 12,668 individuals (44.9% female, 42.5% African American/Black, 42.1% European American/white). Using latent variables for each phenotype, we modelled direct and indirect associations of ACEs with substance dependence, mediated by mood/anxiety disorders (the forward or ‘self-medication’ model) and of ACEs with mood/anxiety disorders, mediated by substance dependence (the reverse or ‘substance-induced’ model). In a subsample, we tested polygenic scores for the substance dependence and mood/anxiety disorder factors as moderators in the mediation models. Although there were significant indirect paths in both directions, mediation by mood/anxiety disorders (the forward model) was greater than that by substance dependence (the reverse model). Greater genetic risk for substance use disorders was associated with a weaker direct association between ACEs and substance dependence in both ancestry groups (reflecting gene × environment interactions) and a weaker indirect association in European-ancestry individuals (reflecting moderated mediation). We found greater evidence that substance dependence reflects self-medication of mood/anxiety disorders than that mood/anxiety disorders are substance induced. Among individuals at higher genetic risk for substance dependence, ACEs were less associated with that outcome. Following exposure to ACEs, multiple pathways appear to underlie the associations between mood/anxiety disorders and substance dependence. Specification of these pathways could inform individually targeted prevention and treatment approaches.","2024-08","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:26:30","1616-1627","","8","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01885-w.pdf","","Addiction; Translational research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through distributed cognition and coordination, collectives can achieve outcomes that exceed the capabilities of individuals—even experts—resulting in improved accuracy and novel capabilities. Often, collective intelligence is supported by information technology, such as online prediction markets that elicit the ‘wisdom of crowds’, online forums that structure collective deliberation or digital platforms that crowdsource knowledge from the public. Large language models, however, are transforming how information is aggregated, accessed and transmitted online. Here we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges this transformation poses for collective intelligence. We bring together interdisciplinary perspectives from industry and academia to identify potential benefits, risks, policy-relevant considerations and open research questions, culminating in a call for a closer examination of how large language models affect humans’ ability to collectively tackle complex problems.","2024-09","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:28:52","1643-1655","","9","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01959-9.pdf","","Society; Science; technology and society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This seemingly trivial question exposes one of the most conspicuous blind spots in our understanding of cultural evolution: the emergence of what we perceive today as ‘modern’ economic behaviour. Here we test the hypothesis that consumption patterns in prehistoric Europe (around 2300–800 bce) can be explained by standard economic theory, predicting that everyday expenses are log-normally distributed and correlated to supply, demand and income. On the basis of a large database of metal objects spanning northern and southern Europe (n = 23,711), we identify metal fragments as money, address them as proxies of consumption and observe that, starting around 1500 bce, their mass values become log-normally distributed. We simulate two alternative scenarios and show that: (1) random behaviour cannot produce the distributions observed in the archaeological data and (2) modern economic behaviour provides the best-fitting model for prehistoric consumption.","2024-09","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:29:13","1660-1675","","9","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01926-4.pdf","","Economics; Archaeology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we provide insight on credit–welfare state trade-offs vis-à-vis unemployment insurance generosity by leveraging a large sample of credit data that allow us to separate credit cards, personal loans and alternative financial services loans and to analyse heterogeneity in credit use by household income. We find that more generous state unemployment insurance benefits were associated with a lower probability of high-cost credit use during the first seven quarters of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This inverse association was concentrated among consumers living in low-income households.

Here we provide evidence for a novel psychological pathway for the expression of such biases, in which they arise as a consequence of the automatized mechanisms by which humans retrieve words to produce sentences. Four experiments show that, when describing events, speakers tend to mention people who are more like them first and, thus, tend to highlight the perspectives of their own social groups. This ‘like me’ effect was seen in speakers from multiple demographic groups, in both English and Chinese speakers and in both first- and second-language English speakers. Psycholinguistic manipulations pinpoint that the bias is caused by greater accessibility in memory of words that refer to in-group than out-group members. These data provide a new cognitive explanation for why people produce biased language and highlight how detailed cognitive theories can have social implications.","2024-09","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:29:23","1706-1715","","9","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01943-3.pdf","","Human behaviour; Language and linguistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that in some environments, it is more efficient to use backward prediction, which specifies what present events are likely to precede a given future event. This is particularly the case in diverging environments, where possible future events outnumber possible present events. Correspondingly, in six preregistered experiments (n = 1,299) involving both simple decision-making and more challenging planning tasks, we find that humans engage in backward prediction in divergent environments and use forward prediction in convergent environments.

In contrast, we show that multiple motor programmes can be acquired on the basis of the preceding uncertainty of the decision, indicating that decision uncertainty functions as a contextual cue for motor memory. The actions learned after making certain (uncertain) decisions are only partially transferred to uncertain (certain) decisions. Participants were able to form distinct motor memories for the same movement on the basis of the preceding decision uncertainty. Crucially, this contextual effect generalizes to novel stimuli with matched uncertainty levels, demonstrating that decision uncertainty is itself a contextual cue.

However, their decision behaviour, including the facts that they are deterministic and use equal numbers of computations for easy and difficult stimuli, differs markedly from human decision-making, thus limiting their applicability as models of human perceptual behaviour. Here we develop a new neural network, RTNet, that generates stochastic decisions and human-like response time (RT) distributions. We further performed comprehensive tests that showed RTNet reproduces all foundational features of human accuracy, RT and confidence and does so better than all current alternatives. To test RTNet’s ability to predict human behaviour on novel images, we collected accuracy, RT and confidence data from 60 human participants performing a digit discrimination task. We found that the accuracy, RT and confidence produced by RTNet for individual novel images correlated with the same quantities produced by human participants. Critically, human participants who were more similar to the average human performance were also found to be closer to RTNet’s predictions, suggesting that RTNet successfully captured average human behaviour. Overall, RTNet is a promising model of human RTs that exhibits the critical signatures of perceptual decision-making.","2024-09","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:29:39","1752-1770","","9","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01914-8.pdf","","Perception; Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We applied genomic structural equation modelling to derive a poverty common factor from household income, occupational income and social deprivation. Then, using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that schizophrenia and ADHD causally contribute to poverty, while poverty contributes to major depressive disorder and schizophrenia but decreases the risk of anorexia nervosa. Poverty may also contribute to ADHD, albeit with uncertainty due to unbalanced pleiotropy. The effects of poverty were reduced by approximately 30% when we adjusted for cognitive ability.

Thus far, causal evidence on whether and in what pattern mental well-being impacts healthy aging and the underlying mediating pathways is unknown. Applying genetic instruments of the well-being spectrum and its four dimensions including life satisfaction, positive affect, neuroticism and depressive symptoms (n = 80,852 to 2,370,390), we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses to estimate the causal effect of mental well-being on the genetically independent phenotype of aging (aging-GIP), a robust and representative aging phenotype, and its components including resilience, self-rated health, healthspan, parental lifespan and longevity (n = 36,745 to 1,012,240). Analyses were adjusted for income, education and occupation. All the data were from the largest available genome-wide association studies in populations of European descent. Better mental well-being spectrum (each one Z-score higher) was causally associated with a higher aging-GIP (β [95% confidence interval (CI)] in different models ranging from 1.00 [0.82–1.18] to 1.07 [0.91–1.24] standard deviations (s.d.)) independent of socioeconomic indicators. Similar association patterns were seen for resilience (β [95% CI] ranging from 0.97 [0.82–1.12] to 1.04 [0.91–1.17] s.d.), self-rated health (0.61 [0.43–0.79] to 0.76 [0.59–0.93] points), healthspan (odds ratio [95% CI] ranging from 1.23 [1.02–1.48] to 1.35 [1.11–1.65]) and parental lifespan (1.77 [0.010–3.54] to 2.95 [1.13–4.76] years). Two-step Mendelian randomization mediation analyses identified 33 out of 106 candidates as mediators between the well-being spectrum and the aging-GIP: mainly lifestyles (for example, TV watching and smoking), behaviours (for example, medication use) and diseases (for example, heart failure, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, stroke, coronary atherosclerosis and ischaemic heart disease), each exhibiting a mediation proportion of >5%. These findings underscore the importance of mental well-being in promoting healthy aging and inform preventive targets for bridging aging disparities attributable to suboptimal mental health.","2024-09","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:29:52","1798-1809","","9","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01905-9.pdf","","Human behaviour; Health policy; Risk factors; Ageing; Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we developed three polygenic risk scores, called MetaPRSs, for coronary artery disease, ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage by combining PRSs for CVD and CVD-related risk factors in 96,400 participants from the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank. Genetic and lifestyle risks were categorized by the disease-specific MetaPRSs and the number of unfavourable lifestyles. High genetic risk and unfavourable lifestyles were found to be more strongly associated with early than late onset of CVD outcomes in men and women. Change from unfavourable to favourable lifestyles resulted in 14.7-, 2.5- and 2.6-fold greater reductions in incidence rates of early-onset coronary artery disease and ischaemic stroke and late-onset coronary artery disease in high than low genetic risk group.

Here the authors examine the integration of GenAI as a tool for human learning, addressing its promises and challenges from a holistic viewpoint that integrates insights from learning sciences, educational technology and human–computer interaction. GenAI promises to enhance learning experiences by scaling personalized support, diversifying learning materials, enabling timely feedback and innovating assessment methods. However, it also presents critical issues such as model imperfections, ethical dilemmas and the disruption of traditional assessments. Thus, cultivating AI literacy and adaptive skills is imperative for facilitating informed engagement with GenAI technologies. Rigorous research across learning contexts is essential to evaluate GenAI’s effect on human cognition, metacognition and creativity. Humanity must learn with and about GenAI, ensuring that it becomes a powerful ally in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, rather than a crutch that undermines our intellectual abilities.","2024-10","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:33:21","1839-1850","","10","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02004-5.pdf","","Education; Human behaviour; Complex networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and artificial intelligence thought partners can engage, and we propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships.

To ensure more robust and resilient human–machine communities, we require a new sociology of humans and machines.

In this preregistered experiment, we tested two scientific consensus messages, a classic message on the reality of human-caused climate change and an updated message additionally emphasizing scientific agreement that climate change is a crisis. Across online convenience samples from 27 countries (n = 10,527), the classic message substantially reduces misperceptions (d = 0.47, 95% CI (0.41, 0.52)) and slightly increases climate change beliefs (from d = 0.06, 95% CI (0.01, 0.11) to d = 0.10, 95% CI (0.04, 0.15)) and worry (d = 0.05, 95% CI (−0.01, 0.10)) but not support for public action directly. The updated message is equally effective but provides no added value. Both messages are more effective for audiences with lower message familiarity and higher misperceptions, including those with lower trust in climate scientists and right-leaning ideologies.

Across five experiments, we asked participants to use ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) to generate creative ideas for various everyday and innovation-related problems, including choosing a creative gift for a teenager, making a toy, repurposing unused items and designing an innovative dining table. We found that using ChatGPT increased the creativity of the generated ideas compared with not using any technology or using a conventional Web search (Google). This effect remained robust regardless of whether the problem required consideration of many (versus few) constraints and whether it was viewed as requiring empathetic concern. Furthermore, ChatGPT was most effective at generating incrementally (versus radically) new ideas. Process evidence suggests that the positive influence of ChatGPT can be attributed to its capability to combine remotely related concepts into a cohesive form, leading to a more articulate presentation of ideas.","2024-10","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:34:00","1906-1914","","10","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01953-1.pdf","","Human behaviour; Business and management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This question has occupied a central place in the philosophy of science, stimulating heated debates but yielding no clear consensus. Many explanations can be understood in terms of whether and how they view the expansion of knowledge as proceeding through the accretion of scientific concepts into larger conceptual structures. Here we examine these views empirically by analysing 2,605,224 papers spanning five decades from both the social sciences (Web of Science) and the physical sciences (American Physical Society). Using natural language processing techniques, we create semantic networks of concepts, wherein noun phrases become linked when used in the same paper abstract. We then detect the core/periphery structures of these networks, wherein core concepts are densely connected sets of highly central nodes and periphery concepts are sparsely connected nodes that are highly connected to the core. For both the social and physical sciences, we observe increasingly rigid conceptual cores accompanied by the proliferation of periphery concepts. Subsequently, we examine the relationship between conceptual structure and the growth of scientific knowledge, finding that scientific works are more innovative in fields with cores that have higher conceptual churn and with larger cores. Furthermore, scientific consensus is associated with reduced conceptual churn and fewer conceptual cores. Overall, our findings suggest that while the organization of scientific concepts is important for the growth of knowledge, the mechanisms vary across time.","2024-10","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:34:06","1915-1923","","10","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01957-x.pdf","","Science; technology and society; Sociology; Computer science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We discovered three response profiles that differ in their temporal dynamics. These profiles appear to reflect different temporal receptive windows, with average windows of about 1, 4 and 6 words, respectively.

Nevertheless, the empirical evidence supporting this notion is largely based on correlational studies, warranting further investigation into the causal relationship. Here we identify the causal effect of video gaming on mental well-being in Japan (2020–2022) using game console lotteries as a natural experiment. Employing approaches designed for causal inference on survey data (n = 97,602), we found that game console ownership, along with increased game play, improved mental well-being. The console ownership reduced psychological distress and improved life satisfaction by 0.1–0.6 standard deviations. Furthermore, a causal forest machine learning algorithm revealed divergent impacts between different types of console, with one showing smaller benefits for adolescents and females while the other showed larger benefits for adolescents. These findings highlight the complex impact of digital media on mental well-being and the importance of considering differential screen time effects.","2024-10","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:34:19","1943-1956","","10","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01948-y.pdf","","Human behaviour; Science; technology and society; Epidemiology; Interdisciplinary studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Next, we conduct meta-analyses across 21 experiments (total N = 14,133) in which participants evaluated true and false news posts and were randomized to either see no warning labels or to see warning labels on a high proportion of the false posts. Warning labels were on average effective at reducing belief in (27.6% reduction), and sharing of (24.7% reduction), false headlines. While warning effects were smaller for participants with less trust in fact-checkers, warning labels nonetheless significantly reduced belief in (12.9% reduction), and sharing of (16.7% reduction), false news even for those most distrusting of fact-checkers.

Understanding why IMs increase or decrease is pivotal in developing interventions to support mental health. In this preregistered meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42021224835), we included 134 articles (131 techniques, 606 effect sizes and 12,074 non-clinical participants) to investigate how experimental techniques alter IM frequency, intrusion-related distress and symptoms arising from lab-analogue trauma exposure. Eligible articles were identified by searching eight databases until 12 December 2023. To test potential publication biases, we employed methods including Egger’s test and three-parameter selection models. We employed three-level multilevel modelling and meta-regressions to examine whether and how experimental techniques would modulate IM frequency and associated outcomes. Results showed that techniques (behavioural, pharmacological, neuromodulation) significantly reduced intrusion frequency (g = 0.16, 95% confidence interval [0.09, 0.23]). Notably, techniques aimed to reduce IMs also ameliorated intrusion-related distress and symptoms, while techniques that increased IMs exacerbated these related outcomes, thus highlighting IM’s centrality in PTSD-like symptoms. Techniques tapping into mental imagery processing (for example, trauma reminder followed by playing Tetris) reduced intrusions when administered immediately after, or at a delayed time after trauma. Although our meta-analysis is limited to symptoms induced by lab-analogue trauma exposure, some lab-based results have now generalized to real-world trauma and IMs, highlighting the promising utility of lab-analogue trauma paradigms for intervention development.","2024-10","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:34:31","1968-1987","","10","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01956-y.pdf","","Human behaviour; Post-traumatic stress disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fusiform wordform areas co-ripple with virtually all language areas, maximally from 200 to 400 ms post-word-onset. Semantically specified target words evoke strong co-rippling between wordform, semantic, executive and response areas from 400 to 800 ms, with increased co-rippling between semantic, executive and response areas prior to correct responses. Co-ripples were phase-locked at zero lag over long distances (>12 cm), especially when many areas were co-rippling. General co-activation, indexed by non-oscillatory high gamma, was mainly confined to early latencies in fusiform and earlier visual areas, preceding co-ripples. These findings suggest that widespread synchronous co-ripples may assist the integration of multiple cortical areas for sustained periods during cognition.","2024-10","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-09-03 20:44:55","2025-08-17 10:34:36","1988-2002","","10","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01952-2.pdf","","Language; Decision; Consciousness; Neuronal physiology; Sensorimotor processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide a critical evaluation of the impact of differences across five independently developed minimal preprocessing pipelines for functional magnetic resonance imaging. We show that, even when handling identical data, interpipeline agreement was only moderate, critically shedding light on a factor that limits cross-study reproducibility. We show that low interpipeline agreement can go unrecognized until the reliability of the underlying data is high, which is increasingly the case as the field progresses. Crucially we show that, when interpipeline agreement is compromised, so too is the consistency of insights from brain-wide association studies.

External validation, or the evaluation of a model in external datasets, is the gold standard in evaluating the generalizability of models in neuroimaging. Unlike typical studies, external validation involves two sample sizes: the training and the external sample sizes. Thus, traditional power calculations may not be appropriate. Here we ran over 900 million resampling-based simulations in functional and structural connectivity data to investigate the relationship between training sample size, external sample size, phenotype effect size, theoretical power and simulated power. Our analysis included a wide range of datasets: the Healthy Brain Network, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, the Human Connectome Project (Development and Young Adult), the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain Project, and the Chinese Human Connectome Project; and phenotypes: age, body mass index, matrix reasoning, working memory, attention problems, anxiety/depression symptoms and relational processing. High effect size predictions achieved adequate power with training and external sample sizes of a few hundred individuals, whereas low and medium effect size predictions required hundreds to thousands of training and external samples. In addition, most previous external validation studies used sample sizes prone to low power, and theoretical power curves should be adjusted for the training sample size. Furthermore, model performance in internal validation often informed subsequent external validation performance (Pearson’s r difference <0.2), particularly for well-harmonized datasets. These results could help decide how to power future external validation studies.","2024-10","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-08-17 10:34:47","2018-2033","","10","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01931-7.pdf","","Scientific community; Cognitive neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study examined how cognitive and non-cognitive skills are associated with academic achievement from ages 7 to 16 years in a sample of over 10,000 children from England and Wales. The results showed that the association between non-cognitive skills and academic achievement increased across development. Twin and polygenic scores analyses found that the links between non-cognitive genetics and academic achievement became stronger over the school years. The results from within-family analyses indicated that non-cognitive genetic effects on academic achievement could not simply be attributed to confounding by environmental differences between nuclear families, consistent with a possible role for evocative/active gene–environment correlations.

The differential treatment of URM women was mitigated when external reviewers highlighted candidates’ scholarship more in their review letters.

Here we report cross-linguistic evidence for the lengthening of word-initial consonants across a typologically diverse sample of 51 languages. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we find that on average, word-initial consonants are about 13 ms longer than word-medial consonants. The cross-linguistic distribution of the effect indicates that despite individual differences in the phonology of the sampled languages, the lengthening of word-initial consonants is a widespread strategy to mark the onset of words in the continuous acoustic signal of human speech.

We analysed a dataset with representative samples from 74 countries (n = 77,242), providing a multinational test of theoretical claims that individuals’ ongoing emotional states predict their economic preferences regarding time or risk. Overall, more positive self-reported emotions generally predicted a willingness to wait for delayed rewards or to take favourable risks, in line with some existing theories.

While this requires knowledge of how people are connected, networks are too large to have first-hand experience with every possible route between individuals. How, then, are people able to accurately track information flow through social networks? Here we find that people immediately cache abstract knowledge about social network structure as they learn who is friends with whom, which enables the identification of efficient routes between remotely connected individuals. These cognitive maps of social networks, which are built while learning, are then reshaped through overnight rest. During these extended periods of rest, a replay-like mechanism helps to make these maps increasingly abstract, which privileges improvements in social navigation accuracy for the longest communication paths that span distinct communities within the network. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the sophisticated mental representations humans use for social navigation.","2024-11","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-08-17 10:50:29","2156-2167","","11","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01990-w.pdf","","Psychology; Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To break this limit, we devised a sniff-triggered apparatus that controls odorant deliveries within a sniff with a precision of 18 milliseconds. Using this apparatus, we show through rigorous psychophysical testing of 229 participants (649 sessions) that two odorants presented in one order and its reverse become perceptually discriminable when the stimulus onset asynchrony is merely 60 milliseconds (Cohen’s d = 0.48; 95% confidence interval, (55, 59); 120-millisecond difference). Discrimination performance improves with the length of stimulus onset asynchrony and is independent of explicit knowledge of the temporal order of odorants or the relative amount of odorant molecules accumulated in a sniff. Our findings demonstrate that human olfactory perception is sensitive to chemical dynamics within a single sniff and provide behavioural evidence for a temporal code of odour identity.","2024-11","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-08-17 10:50:32","2168-2178","","11","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01984-8.pdf","","Perception; Human behaviour; Olfactory system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, object vision supports diverse behavioural goals, suggesting basic limitations of this category-centric framework. To address these limitations, we mapped a series of dimensions derived from a large-scale analysis of human similarity judgements directly onto the brain. Our results reveal broadly distributed representations of behaviourally relevant information, demonstrating selectivity to a wide variety of novel dimensions while capturing known selectivities for visual features and categories. Behaviour-derived dimensions were superior to categories at predicting brain responses, yielding mixed selectivity in much of visual cortex and sparse selectivity in category-selective clusters. This framework reconciles seemingly disparate findings regarding regional specialization, explaining category selectivity as a special case of sparse response profiles among representational dimensions, suggesting a more expansive view on visual processing in the human brain.","2024-11","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-08-17 10:50:36","2179-2193","","11","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01980-y.pdf","","Perception; Object vision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we test whether these signatures of the choice process can be temporally dissociated from additional, choice-‘independent’ value signals. Indeed, EEG activity during value-based choice revealed distinct spatiotemporal clusters, with a stimulus-locked cluster reflecting affective reactions to choice sets and a response-locked cluster reflecting choice difficulty. Surprisingly, ‘neither’ of these clusters met the criteria for an evidence accumulation signal. Instead, we found that stimulus-locked activity can ‘mimic’ an evidence accumulation process when aligned to the response. Re-analysing four previous studies, including three perceptual decision-making studies, we show that response-locked signatures of evidence accumulation disappear when stimulus-locked and response-locked activity are modelled jointly. Collectively, our findings show that neural signatures of value can reflect choice-independent processes and look deceptively like evidence accumulation.","2024-11","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-08-17 10:50:41","2194-2208","","11","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01971-z.pdf","","Human behaviour; Decision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we combined behavioural, genetic and hospitalization data from the UK Biobank to examine the associations of loneliness with a wide range of non-overlapping diseases. During a median 12.2-year follow-up, loneliness was associated with greater risks in 13 of 14 disease categories and 30 of 56 individual diseases considered. Of the 30 diseases significantly associated with loneliness, 26 had genetic data available for Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. After Benjamini‒Hochberg correction and multiple sensitivity analyses within the MR framework, non-causal associations were identified between genetic liability to loneliness and 20 out of the 26 specific diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic liver diseases, chronic kidney disease, most neurological diseases and the other common diseases. Genetic liability to loneliness was only potentially causally associated with the remaining six diseases. Socioeconomic factors, health behaviours, baseline depressive symptoms and comorbidities largely explained the associations between loneliness and diseases. Overall, our study revealed a dissociation between observational and genetic evidence regarding the associations of loneliness with multiple diseases. These findings suggest that loneliness may serve as a potential surrogate marker rather than a causal risk factor for most diseases tested here.","2024-11","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-08-17 10:50:44","2209-2221","","11","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01970-0.pdf","","Risk factors; Diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ‘big five’ personality traits, which include neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, are a widely accepted and influential framework for understanding and describing human personality. Of the big five personality traits, neuroticism has most often been the focus of genetic studies and is linked to various mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Our knowledge of the genetic architecture of the other four personality traits is more limited. Here, utilizing the Million Veteran Program cohort, we conducted a genome-wide association study in individuals of European and African ancestry. Adding other published data, we performed genome-wide association study meta-analysis for each of the five personality traits with sample sizes ranging from 237,390 to 682,688. We identified 208, 14, 3, 2 and 7 independent genome-wide significant loci associated with neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, respectively. These findings represent 62 novel loci for neuroticism, as well as the first genome-wide significant loci discovered for agreeableness. Gene-based association testing revealed 254 genes showing significant association with at least one of the five personality traits. Transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide analysis identified altered expression of genes and proteins such as CRHR1, SLC12A5, MAPT and STX4. Pathway enrichment and drug perturbation analyses identified complex biology underlying human personality traits. We also studied the inter-relationship of personality traits with 1,437 other traits in a phenome-wide genetic correlation analysis, identifying new associations. Mendelian randomization showed positive bidirectional effects between neuroticism and depression and anxiety, while a negative bidirectional effect was observed for agreeableness and these psychiatric traits. This study improves our comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture underlying personality traits and their relationship to other complex human traits.","2024-11","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-09-03 20:44:56","2025-08-17 10:50:50","2235-2249","","11","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01951-3.pdf","","Human behaviour; Genetic variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that children fact-check claims more and are better able to catch misinformation when they have been exposed to detectable inaccuracies. In two experiments (N = 122), 4–7-year-old children exposed to falsity (as opposed to all true information) sampled more evidence before verifying a test claim in a novel domain. Children’s evidentiary standards were graded: fact-checking increased with higher proportions of false statements heard during exposure. A simulation suggests that children’s behaviour is adaptive, because increased fact-checking in more dubious environments supports the discovery of potential misinformation. Importantly, children were least diligent at fact-checking a new claim when all prior information was true, suggesting that sanitizing children’s informational environments may inadvertently dampen their natural scepticism. Instead, these findings support the counterintuitive possibility that exposing children to some nonsense may scaffold vigilance towards more subtle misinformation in the future.","2024-12","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-08-17 11:01:36","2322-2329","","12","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01992-8.pdf","","Human behaviour; Science; technology and society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Psychological inoculation—an intervention intended to help people identify manipulation techniques—is being adopted at scale around the globe. Yet the efficacy of this approach for increasing belief accuracy remains unclear, as prior work uses synthetic materials that do not contain claims of truth. To address this issue, we conducted five studies with 7,286 online participants using a set of news headlines based on real-world true/false content in which we systematically varied the presence or absence of emotional manipulation. Although an emotional manipulation inoculation did help participants identify emotional manipulation, there was no improvement in participants’ ability to tell truth from falsehood. However, when the inoculation was paired with an intervention that draws people’s attention to accuracy, the combined intervention did successfully improve truth discernment (by increasing belief in true content). These results provide evidence for synergy between popular misinformation interventions.","2024-12","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-08-17 11:01:43","2330-2341","","12","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02023-2.pdf","","Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, scholars have long expressed concerns about the reliability and interpretation of looking behaviours. We evaluated these concerns using a pre-registered (https://osf.io/jghc3), systematic meta-analysis of 76 published and unpublished studies of infants’ early physical and psychological reasoning (total n = 1,899; 3- to 12-month-old infants; database search and call for unpublished studies conducted July to August 2022). We studied two effects in the same datasets: looking towards expected versus unexpected events (violation of expectation (VOE)) and looking towards visually familiar versus visually novel events (perceptual novelty (PN)). Most studies implemented methods to minimize the risk of bias (for example, ensuring that experimenters were naive to the conditions and reporting inter-rater reliability). There was mixed evidence about publication bias for the VOE effect. Most centrally to our research aims, we found that these two effects varied systematically—with roughly equal effect sizes (VOE, standardized mean difference 0.290 and 95% confidence interval (0.208, 0.372); PN, standardized mean difference 0.239 and 95% confidence interval (0.109, 0.369))—but independently, based on different predictors. Age predicted infants’ looking responses to unexpected events, but not visually novel events. Habituation predicted infants’ looking responses to visually novel events, but not unexpected events. From these findings, we suggest that conceptual and perceptual novelty independently influence infants’ looking behaviour.","2024-12","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-08-17 11:01:51","2342-2356","","12","8","","Nat Hum Behav","Perceptual and conceptual novelty independently guide infant looking behaviour","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01965-x.pdf","","Psychology; Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is no consensus about whether EF delay represents a transdiagnostic feature of NDCs. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized 180 studies reporting two or more NDC comparisons on EF, examined differences between NDCs, and the moderating effects of gender, age, publication year, DSM editions and assessment types. Studies using established EF measures across seven domains (attention, fluency, set-shifting, set-switching, response inhibition, planning and working memory) in participants under 18 were included. Summary effects were compared: (1) for all reported NDCs relative to control, (2) for each individual NDC relative to control and (3) between NDC groups. Results confirmed that EF delay was a transdiagnostic feature of neurodevelopmental delay, with a moderate effect size of delay across all NDCs (g = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–0.63) compared with control. This effect increased with comorbidities (g = 0.72, 95% CI 0.59–0.86), DSM-5 criteria and informant measures. Comparisons between NDCs revealed few differences: children with tic disorders (TD) showed smaller EF delays, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed larger delays in attention, response inhibition, planning and working memory compared with TD and specific learning disorders, while children with autism spectrum disorders showed greater delays on set-switching compared with ADHD. Findings support transdiagnostic models of neurodevelopment to further a developmentally sensitive science that can reveal how EF delays contribute to brain circuitry, symptom profiles and functioning, and ultimately support early interventions and outcomes for all children with NDCs.","2024-12","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-08-17 11:01:58","2357-2366","","12","8","","Nat Hum Behav","Executive function in children with neurodevelopmental conditions","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02000-9.pdf","","Paediatric research; ADHD; Autism spectrum disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, previous investigations of this association have primarily focused on Western samples with substantial heterogeneity. Our study aimed to examine the association between marital status and depressive symptoms across countries with diverse cultural backgrounds using a large-scale, two-stage, cross-country analysis. We used nationally representative, de-identified individual-level data from seven countries, including the USA, the UK, Mexico, Ireland, Korea, China and Indonesia (106,556 cross-sectional and 20,865 longitudinal participants), representing approximately 541 million adults. The follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 18 years. Our analysis revealed that unmarried individuals had a higher risk of depressive symptoms than their married counterparts across all countries (pooled odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61–2.14). However, the magnitude of this risk was influenced by country, sex and education level, with greater risk in Western versus Eastern countries (β = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16–0.56; P < 0.001), among males versus females (β = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.003–0.47; P = 0.047) and among those with higher versus lower educational attainment (β2 = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.11–0.56; P = 0.003). Furthermore, alcohol drinking causally mediated increased later depressive symptom risk among widowed, divorced/separated and single Chinese, Korean and Mexican participants (all P < 0.001). Similarly, smoking was as identified as a causal mediator among single individuals in China and Mexico, and the results remained unchanged in the bootstrap resampling validation and the sensitivity analyses. Our cross-country analysis suggests that unmarried individuals may be at greater risk of depression, and any efforts to mitigate this risk should consider the roles of cultural context, sex, educational attainment and substance use.","2024-12","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-08-17 11:02:11","2392-2405","","12","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02033-0.pdf","","Human behaviour; Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we conducted an umbrella review encompassing 194 observational meta-analyses, 10 Mendelian randomization studies and 748 interventional meta-analyses to appraise the published evidence on the associations between maternal adiposity and perinatal and offspring outcomes. Evidence grading suggested that 17 (8.8%) observational meta-analyses were supported by convincing evidence for 12 outcomes: maternal adiposity was associated with an increased risk of caesarean delivery following labour induction, infant mortality, Apgar score <7 at 1 min, antenatal depression, offspring overweight and obesity, early timing of puberty onset in daughters, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, congenital heart disease and spina bifida (OR/RR ranging from 1.14 to 2.31), as well as increased offspring body fat percent and fat mass (SMD 0.31 and 0.35, respectively). Among these outcomes, interventional meta-analyses supported that maternal weight loss interventions significantly reduced the risk of antenatal depression but not low Apgar scores; these interventions also could not reduce offspring fat mass or body fat percent. Evidence from Mendelian randomization studies supported a causal relationship between maternal adiposity and gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, birth size and offspring adiposity. Our findings highlight that while observational meta-analyses reveal associations between maternal adiposity and various adverse perinatal and offspring outcomes, convincing, unbiased evidence or support from Mendelian randomization studies is limited. Maternal pre-conceptional and prenatal weight loss interventions can reduce some, but not all, of these adverse effects.","2024-12","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-08-17 11:02:20","2406-2422","","12","8","","Nat Hum Behav","Maternal adiposity and perinatal and offspring outcomes","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01994-6.pdf","","Epidemiology; Obesity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, no direct link between phase precession and memory has been established. Here we recorded single-neuron activity and local field potentials in the human medial temporal lobe while participants (n = 22) encoded and retrieved memories of movie clips. Bouts of theta and phase precession occurred following cognitive boundaries during movie watching and following stimulus onsets during memory retrieval. Phase precession was dynamic, with different neurons exhibiting precession in different task periods. Phase precession strength provided information about memory encoding and retrieval success that was complementary with firing rates.

Such an ability to bootstrap enables us to grow rich mental concepts despite limited cognitive resources. Here we present a computational model of conceptual bootstrapping. This model uses a dynamic conceptual repertoire that can cache and later reuse elements of earlier insights in principled ways, modelling learning as a series of compositional generalizations. This model predicts systematically different learned concepts when the same evidence is processed in different orders, without any extra assumptions about previous beliefs or background knowledge. Across four behavioural experiments (total               n                = 570), we demonstrate strong curriculum-order and conceptual garden-pathing effects that closely resemble our model predictions and differ from those of alternative accounts.

Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and AI are better than either alone. Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems eLibrary) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, AI alone and human–AI combinations. First, we found that, on average, human–AI combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or AI alone (Hedges’               g                = −0.23; 95% confidence interval, −0.39 to −0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed AI alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when AI outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human–AI collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human–AI systems.","2024-10-28","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-01 14:26:25","2293-2303","","12","8","","Nat Hum Behav","When combinations of humans and AI are useful","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the causal contribution of specific patterns of oscillatory activity within the human striatum is unknown. To address this question, we exploited a recently developed non-invasive deep brain stimulation technique called transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) during reinforcement motor learning with concurrent neuroimaging, in a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind study. Striatal tTIS applied at 80 Hz, but not at 20 Hz, abolished the benefits of reinforcement on motor learning. This effect was related to a selective modulation of neural activity within the striatum. Moreover, 80 Hz, but not 20 Hz, tTIS increased the neuromodulatory influence of the striatum on frontal areas involved in reinforcement motor learning. These results show that tTIS can non-invasively and selectively modulate a striatal mechanism involved in reinforcement learning, expanding our tools for the study of causal relationships between deep brain structures and human behaviour.","2024-05-29","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-03 20:44:57","2025-09-01 14:27:18","1581-1598","","8","8","","Nat Hum Behav","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
