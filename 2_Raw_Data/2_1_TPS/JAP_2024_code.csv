Theory (i.e., the political affiliation model, PAM) and research show that during cybervetting, recruiters are exposed to job-unrelated information such as political affiliation, which might trigger similarity-attraction effects and bias hireability judgments. However, as the PAM was developed in a more polarized two-party political system, it is pivotal to test and refine the PAM in a multiparty context. Therefore, we asked working professionals from the United States (two-party context, N = 266) and Germany (multiparty context, N = 747) to rate an applicant’s hireability after cybervetting a LinkedIn profile that was manipulated in a between-subjects design (party affiliation by individuating information). Key tenets of the PAM could be transferred to multiparty contexts: The political similarity-attraction effect predicted hireability judgments beyond job-related individuating information, especially regarding organizational citizenship behavior. In addition, in a multiparty context, these biasing effects of political similarity and liking were not attenuated. Yet, there were also differences: In a multiparty context, political similarity had to be operationalized in terms of political value similarity and recruiters’ political interest emerged as a significant moderator of the effects. So, this study refines the PAM by showing in multiparty contexts the importance of (a) a values-based perspective (instead of a behavioral political affiliation perspective) and (b) political interest (instead of identification). Accordingly, we provide a more nuanced understanding of when political affiliation similarity contributes to perceived overall similarity in affecting liking and hireability judgments in cybervetting.

Despite valuable insights gained from the collective turnover literature as well as parallel research concerning related or coordinated quitting, a holistic understanding of the unique group turnover phenomenon is needed, both to synthesize existing research across multiple domains and disciplines and to kindle new inquiries regarding its dynamic nature and developmental process. To this end, we begin by conducting an integrative review of research relating to group turnover, reinterpreting it by identifying its common pathways as a function of varying triggers, temporal patterns, and departure destinations. We then leverage the groups literature to explicate group turnover’s self-reinforcing and dynamic nature and propose a three-dimensional Interdependence, Temporality, and Emergence (ITE) framework that accounts for its developmental process. Using this framework, we develop an illustrative set of propositions regarding how ITE-related group properties affect the extent to which individual departures might escalate into group turnover of a larger scale and faster speed. Our emphasis on groups as a unique unit of reference thus provides an important conceptual refinement and extension for understanding collective turnover—shifting from a static focus on aggregate exit (rates) to a dynamic focus on the often-coordinated, temporally evolving nature of multiple group member quit events.

A within-person investigation of ambient harassment and voice behavior at work","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001131","","It is clear that sexual harassment has a profound impact on the victims who are targets of these egregious behaviors. Comparably less is known, however, about how other members of the organization react affectively and behaviorally when these acts transpire, and who has stronger reactions to such events. In the current research, we draw from the sexual harassment and vicarious mistreatment literatures to develop a theoretical model that considers how bystanders react behaviorally to ambient harassment—the experience of overhearing sexist and disparaging gender-related comments without necessarily being the direct target of such remarks—by enacting various types of voice behaviors at work via feelings of fear and anger. We also explore whether certain work conditions—namely an organization’s tolerance for sexual harassment—attenuate such reactions, and how gender of the witness to ambient harassment may shape the effects. Across an experimental investigation (Study 1) and an experience sampling study (Study 2), we find that exposure to ambient harassment is positively related to feelings of fear and anger. In Study 2, we further unpack the differential behavioral consequences associated with ambient harassment, finding that while anger is positively related to voice after witnessing ambient harassment, fear negatively contributed to voice behaviors at work. Interestingly, these effects were further exacerbated for employees who worked in an organization tolerant of sexual harassment and for men (vs. women). Combined, our results shed light on how, and when, employees can feel empowered to enact voice behaviors after experiencing ambient harassment.

While a common expectation of leader departure models is that the incoming leader is permanent, it is unclear how unit-level reactions, such as collective turnover and unit performance, might change over time in response to a departure event when the departing leader is replaced with a temporary leader. We draw on context emergent turnover (CET) theory and literature on leader departures to develop and empirically test specific hypotheses exploring relationships among leader departures, collective turnover, and unit performance over time. In addition, we examine the extent to which these relationships are influenced by the temporary status of the incoming leader. Using discontinuous growth models, we examine a longitudinal data set from 324 units within a large Latin American operation of a global direct sales company (N = 3,082 performance periods). Findings indicate that, after a leader departs, there is an immediate increase in collective turnover and that unit performance decreases over time. Further, when the incoming leader is temporary, unit performance increases briefly, but the rate of performance drops over time. Overall, our research offers insights with regard to how leader departures impact unit outcomes, as well as how long such effects last.

However, human effort is inherently finite, which creates a dilemma for employees. Is it better to prioritize capitalizing on existing knowledge structures to maximize immediate performance benefits (exploitation) or develop adaptive capabilities (exploration) at the expense of short-term productivity? Understanding how employees answer this question can inform the design of evidence-based interventions for optimizing and sustaining learning amidst workplace challenges. In this article, we attempt to unpack the composition of on-task effort during performance-based learning by testing the proposition that the information–knowledge gap—a regulatory discrepancy between unknown aspects of a task and a person’s perceived competence in dealing with that task—is the psychological mechanism responsible for guiding effort-allocation decisions during performance-based learning. In Study 1, we found that larger information–knowledge gaps resulted in increased subsequent investments of on-task attention within a sample of adults learning to perform a complex task (N = 121). As participants learned, information–knowledge gaps systematically shrank, resulting in a reduced emphasis on learning-oriented effort (i.e., exploration) relative to achievement-oriented effort (i.e., exploitation) over time. In Study 2 (N = 176), a task-change paradigm revealed that introducing novel demands caused information–knowledge gaps to suddenly expand, which prompted participants to increase on-task effort and shift their focus away from achievement and back toward learning as an adaptive response. Collectively, these findings support the notion that information–knowledge gaps shape how (and when) on-task effort is spent and present a framework for understanding how learners strategically structure their limited attentional resources.

The significant ramifications of unachieved goals on employee well-being and performance thus call for more research efforts to understand how employees respond to unsatisfactory goal progress (e.g., goal-performance discrepancy [GPD]). Interestingly, two paradoxical theoretical perspectives exist on this matter, with the self-regulation perspective suggesting an adaptive feedback loop (i.e., GPD on a given day eventually reduces next-day GPD), whereas the self-focused cognition perspective suggesting a maladaptive feedback loop (i.e., GPD on a given day eventually exacerbates next-day GPD). Taking a temporal lens to integrate these two perspectives, we conducted a daily diary study to map out the self-regulatory cognition mechanisms (i.e., anticipatory thinking) and self-focused cognition mechanisms (i.e., rumination) underlying the feedback loops, and identify employee temporal focus (future and past focuses) as critical cross-level boundary conditions to explain why some react to daily GPD adaptively, whereas others maladaptively. Based on 485 daily reports from 100 work professionals, we revealed that daily GPD at work resulted in reduced next-day GPD via increased after-work anticipatory thinking. Meanwhile, daily GPD also resulted in aggravated next-day GPD via increased after-work rumination. Moreover, employee future focus mitigated the maladaptive cycle, whereas employee past focus hindered the adaptive cycle. Our study thus provides important theoretical and empirical insights into employee goal-pursuit process.

Yet the recovery literature frequently takes an undifferentiated view of both the positive emotions employees experience as well as the negative emotions employees are recovering from. This implicitly assumes that all positive emotions are equally effective in facilitating recovery from all negative emotions. Drawing from theory treating emotional movements as a metaphorical journey, we develop a framework for understanding recovery that highlights the importance of the distance and direction that individuals “travel” when moving from negative emotions to positive emotions during the recovery process. We argue that the negative emotions that people start with from work—that is, their emotional origin—as well as the positive emotions that people end with following leisure activities—that is, their emotional destination—jointly influence the state of being recovered. Across two studies using experience-sampling methodologies, we find that “shorter” journeys consisting of emotional destinations that match the activation level of emotional origins (e.g., experiencing high activation positive emotion [HAP] to counter high activation negative emotion) are effective in promoting recovery, while “longer” journeys consisting of mismatches (e.g., experiencing HAP to counter low activation negative emotion) are ineffective for recovery.

The predominant conceptualization of responses to change has focused on the valence of responses—the degree to which they are positive (e.g., openness to change) versus negative (e.g., resistance to change). Yet, recent theory suggests that rather than a single continuum, ranging from negative to positive, responses to change are better represented with a bidimensional framework including both a valence-based continuum and an activation-based continuum (active vs. passive; Oreg et al., 2018), comprising a change response circumplex. Based on this theoretical framework, we develop and validate a scale for measuring the four dimensions of the change response circumplex (i.e., change acceptance, change proactivity, change disengagement, change resistance). We conducted five studies in which we develop the scale and demonstrate its content validity (Study 1, N = 208), circumplex structure and construct validity (Study 2, N = 221; Study 3, N = 315), concurrent validity (Study 4, N = 588), and predictive validity (Study 5, N = 146). We also demonstrate the usefulness of distinguishing among the four responses for predicting the amount and types of feedback that change recipients provide, and show the particular value of active responses, above and beyond valence.

Management research has just begun to explore the effects of air pollution on employees’ work life. Drawing from the transactional theory of stress (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) and crossover theory (Westman, 2001), we argue that appraisal of air pollution is an important factor that influences leaders and their behavior with subordinates. Specifically, we propose that when leaders appraise severe air pollution, they are more likely to behave abusively toward their subordinates and engage in laissez-faire leadership. We also propose that this relationship is mediated by leaders’ experience of somatic complaints and negative affect. We test our model using an experience sampling study in India of leaders and followers who were located in different cities from each other. Overall, our results highlight how air pollution appraisals can harm not only the leader experiencing the pollution but also subordinates of those leaders. In other words, our counterintuitive finding is that subordinates may be harmed by air pollution to which they are not even directly exposed.

Despite their prevalence and a substantial, multidisciplinary research literature on virtual negative behaviors in general, we lack clear answers regarding if, how, and why conditions differentiating virtual (i.e., computer-mediated) from face-to-face (F2F) work impact perpetrators’, victims’, and bystanders’ involvement in NWB. These questions remain because of an assumed isomorphism (i.e., identical form) within the literature on NWB in F2F and virtual work. We explain why we cannot assume that what is known about perpetrator engagement, victim experience, and bystander intervention from studying F2F NWB applies uniformly to virtual negative work behavior (VNWB). Specifically, we identify how eight conditions of the virtual workplace facilitate three psychological enablers (i.e., ambiguity, anonymity, and (un)accountability) of perpetrators’, victims’, and bystanders’ involvement in VNWB. In doing so, this integrative conceptual review advances a coherent understanding of what is (un)known about VNWB, integrates fragmented theoretical literature, and guides practical intervention. Importantly, we identify limitations of existing research practices that threaten the validity and generalizability of empirical findings. If not addressed, these issues will continue to undermine theoretical development and empirical investigations of F2F NWB and VNWB. Finally, this review points to new areas of inquiry that will meaningfully advance the understanding of NWB in the modern, increasingly virtual workplace.

This article introduces an ecumenical, dynamic, and computational model of the job insecurity–job performance relationship. That is, rather than representing a single theoretical perspective on job insecurity effects, the model includes three key mechanisms through which job insecurity is theorized to impact performance—stress, social exchange, and job preservation motivation—and grounds these in a self-regulatory computational architecture. The model incorporates multiple, dynamic feedback loops that include job performance and job insecurity, as well as individual difference and contextual constructs to project the immediate, short-term, and long-term effects of changes to job security and other important variables. Simulations of the model demonstrate that a self-regulating representation of human information processing can produce effects consistent with the major propositions in the job insecurity literature. Moreover, interrupted time-series simulations of a new job insecurity threat reveal how, when, and why performance can stabilize above, near, or below baseline performance levels, sometimes for counterintuitive reasons. Additionally, the model shows how the frequently reported, cross-sectional, negative relationship between job insecurity and job performance can be explained by job performance’s influence on job insecurity. The results imply important considerations and directions for future job insecurity research and demonstrate the value of a formal, dynamic systems approach to theorizing.

To help elucidate this phenomenon, we propose a novel theoretical perspective: East Asians are underselected for leadership positions partially because they are stereotyped as lacking creativity, a prized leadership attribute in U.S. culture. We first tested our proposition in two field studies in a natural setting: Across 33 full class sections of 2,304 Master of Business Administration (MBA) students in a U.S. business program, East Asians were perceived by their classmates as less creative than other ethnicities (e.g., South Asian, White) at the beginning of the MBA program—when the students had limited interactions and thus were likely influenced by creativity stereotypes. Lower perceived creativity mediated why East Asians were less likely than other ethnicities to be nominated (Study 1) and elected (Study 2) as class-section leaders by their classmates. These patterns were robust after accounting for variables such as assertiveness (parallel mediator), leadership motivation, English proficiency, and demographics. These findings were conceptually replicated in two preregistered vignette experiments of non-Asian Americans with managerial experience (Studies 3 and 4, N = 1,775): Compared to candidates of other ethnicities, East Asian American candidates with a substantively identical profile were viewed as less leader-like as a function of lower perceived creativity. Overall, although East Asians are commonly stereotyped as competent, they are also stereotyped as lacking creativity, which can hinder their leadership emergence in U.S. organizations.

Drawing on and extending habit theory, we hypothesize that, controlling for average engagement, engagement variability is negatively related to job performance. We further hypothesize that emotional stability moderates this relationship: Although engagement variability hinders performance when an employee is higher in emotional stability, this effect weakens when an employee is lower in emotional stability. Finally, we hypothesize that flow mediates the interactive effect of engagement variability and emotional stability on performance. We test our hypotheses across three studies: a multisource, ten-wave field study of 160 cadets across three Army and Air Force divisions of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, an experiment with 600 full-time employees, and a multisource, two-week experience sampling study with 152 full-time employees and their supervisors. We find consistent support for engagement variability’s negative relationship with performance and the moderating role of emotional stability, but mixed support for the mediating role of flow. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work.

We empirically test our hypotheses in a three-time multisource study, utilizing a sample of 377 newcomers, 132 leaders, and 721 peers.

However, there is a dearth of evidence on how individuals react and adapt to multiple job changes over their working lives. This study distinguishes adaptation to a single job change in the short term from adaptation to the process of job change in the long term. Drawing on two large-scale, long-running panel data sets from Britain and Australia, it examined how job satisfaction trajectory evolved as individuals made a series of consecutive job changes since they first entered the labor market. Our fixed effect analyses show that in both countries, individuals experienced a stronger honeymoon effect with each successive job change, before gradually reverting to their baseline job satisfaction. In short, the amplitude of the honeymoon–hangover effect increased across multiple job changes. By distinguishing “adaptation to change” from “change in adaptation,” this study generates original insights into the role of job mobility in facilitating career development and extends set point theory from understanding the impact of single life events to recurring life events.

We test our hypotheses in an operational context across four samples (total N = 1,828) to predict selection into Officer Training School in the U.S. Air Force. Boards of three senior officers make selection decisions using a highly structured rating process based on mental ability tests, numeric application information (e.g., number of past jobs, college grades), and narrative application information (e.g., past job duties, achievements, interests, statements of objectives). Results showed that NLP scores of the narrative application generally (a) predict Board scores when combined with test scores and numeric application information at a level of correlation equivalent to the correlation between human raters (.60), (b) add incremental prediction of Board scores beyond mental ability tests and numeric application information, and (c) reduce subgroup differences between racial minorities and nonracial minorities in Board scores compared to mental ability tests and numeric application information.

Results of four studies supported an EVT perspective and showed that apologies were perceived to be relatively more effective when they contradicted gender stereotypes (i.e., communal [agentic] apologies by men [women]). Specifically, Study 1 provided an initial test of the competing hypotheses using celebrity apologies on Twitter. Then, results of three experiments (Studies 2, 3a, and 3b) built upon these initial findings and tested the psychological mechanisms proposed by EVT to explain why counterstereotypical apologies are beneficial (i.e., attributions of interpersonal sensitivity [assertiveness] and enhanced perceptions of benevolence [competence] for men [women]).

According to this perspective, employees who are characteristically self-interested are less likely to engage in UPB. However, recent evidence suggests self-interest may play a larger role in motivating UPB than originally theorized. To clarify this controversy, we offer two different, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, perspectives of UPB—one in which UPB is driven primarily by prosocial motives and one in which it is driven primarily by self-interest. We tested which of these accounts of UPB was more strongly supported by comparing UPB’s relationships with two nomological networks: one containing relatively prosocially motivated constructs and the other containing relatively self-interest-motivated constructs. Two of the eight hypotheses from the prosocial perspective were supported, while seven of the eight hypotheses from the self-interest perspective were supported. Additionally, the average absolute value of UPB’s correlations with prosocial perspective constructs was .09, while the comparable average correlation with self-interest perspective constructs was .33. Thus, the results favored the self-interest perspective. We discuss how these findings change our theoretical understanding of UPB by acknowledging both its prosocial and self-interest motivations, and we accordingly propose a revised definition for UPB that allows for both of these motivations. We also examined more broadly the relationship between UPB and other constructs to provide a comprehensive meta-analytic overview of this literature.

Negotiators with high-value outside offers tend to have greater power and claim higher values in the focal negotiation. We extend this line of work by proposing that the source of alternatives—that is, who negotiators receive an alternative offer from—can significantly shape their negotiation behavior and outcomes. Specifically, we examine how negotiators’ behavior changes when they face a counterpart who has an offer from their rival. Four studies demonstrate that this situation enhances negotiators’ motivation to outperform their counterpart’s alternative by reaching an agreement with the counterpart. This in turn leads the focal negotiator to make less aspirational first offers and eventually claim less value in final agreements. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the existing relationships among actors directly and indirectly involved in a negotiation, reveal a novel motive that can guide negotiators’ behavior and outcomes, and uncover a previously unexplored negotiation strategy.

Thus, making prescreening, admissions, and selection decisions when predictive bias exists violates principles of fairness based on equal treatment and opportunity. First, we conducted a two-part study showing that different types of predictive bias exist. Specifically, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation showing that out-of-sample predictions provide a more precise understanding of the nature of predictive bias—whether it is based on intercept and/or slope differences across groups. Then, we conducted a college admissions study based on 29,734 Black and 304,372 White students, and 35,681 Latinx and 308,818 White students and provided evidence about the existence of both intercept- and slope-based predictive bias. Third, we discuss the nature and different types of predictive bias and offer analytical work to explain why each type exists, thereby providing insights into the causes of different types of predictive bias. We also map the statistical causes of predictive bias onto the existing literature on likely underlying psychological and contextual mechanisms.

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has encountered particular difficulties in diversifying its workforce, and it relies mainly on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) for assigning active-duty recruits to one of 19 specialized training schools. When recruits’ scores fall below ASVAB entrance standards, the USCG sometimes offers admission waivers. Alternatively, recruits can retest until their ASVAB scores meet the entrance standard. Retesting has shown mixed results in the personnel selection literature, so our main interest is to determine whether retesting or waivers best support USCG recruits’ training school outcomes, especially for recruits identifying as an underrepresented minority (URM). We use data from 16,624 USCG recruits entering between 2013 and 2021 and fit augmented inverse propensity weighted models to assess differences in training outcomes by pathway to admission while accounting for self-selection into pathways. Our analyses found (a) no difference in training outcomes between recruits who qualified from their initial scores and recruits who retested, (b) recruits who received waivers were less likely to complete training school on time and spent more time in remedial training when they failed training school compared to those who retested, and (c) improvement in training outcomes for retesting over waivers was larger for recruits identifying as an URM. Results suggest that retesting may be an effective strategy for workforce diversification and for improving outcomes among recruits identifying as an URM.

The present study addresses this question using historical large-scale data across 31 diverse military occupations from the Joint-Service Job Performance Measurement/Enlistment Standards Project (N = 10,088). Across all jobs, results of our meta-analysis find near-zero interactions between Armed Forces Qualification Test score (a composite of math and verbal scores) and time in service when predicting job-specific performance. This finding supports the validity of g for predicting job-specific performance even with increasing job experience and provides no evidence for diminishing validity of g.

Despite this, current estimates of PA reliability are low, leading to decades of criticism regarding the use of PA in organizational contexts. In this article, we argue that current meta-analytical interrater reliability (IRR) coefficients are underestimates and do not reflect the reliability of interest to most practitioners and researchers—the reliability of an employee’s direct supervisor. To establish the reliability of direct supervisor ratings, those making PA ratings must directly supervise employee job performance instead of nonparallel rater designs (e.g., direct supervisor ratings correlated with ratings from a more senior leader). The current meta-analysis identified 22 independent samples that met this more restrictive study inclusion criterion, finding an average observed IRR of .65. We also report reliability estimates for several important contextual moderators, including whether ratings were completed in operational settings (.60) or for research purposes (.67). In sum, we argue that this study’s meta-analytical IRR estimates are the best available estimates of direct supervisor reliability and should be used to guide future research and practice.

For VTs to succeed, the collaborative behavior of team members plays an important role. Drawing from the open systems theory and using a phenomenon-driven approach, we investigate the dynamic pattern of collaborative behavior convergence among members of VTs (i.e., the emergence of collaborative behavior consensus) and its relationship with VT performance. Moreover, we investigate the differential influence of external crises, exemplified by key dynamic facets of the COVID-19 crisis (i.e., COVID-19 health threat and social distance). We used a multilevel approach (i.e., time, individual, and team levels) with the multilevel group-process framework to test our hypotheses. Results from a survey of 3,506 participants nested in 703 teams suggest that collaborative behaviors of VT members tend to converge over time, leading to the emergence of collaborative behavior consensus. Furthermore, a dynamic COVID-19 health threat leads to lower collaborative behavior consensus over time. Moreover, our results show that collaborative behavior consensus is partially positively related to VT performance and is particularly important for VTs with a lower level of collaborative behavior at the end of the collaboration. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

A functional leadership approach to leader-member exchange differentiation","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001164","","The burgeoning literature on leader–member exchange (LMX) differentiation indicates that differentiating LMX relationships within groups has both benefits and costs when it comes to group effectiveness. Although some clarity is emerging surrounding the null total effect of LMX differentiation on group performance, we still know little about how leaders themselves shape the differentiation process. In this article, we extend theory to suggest that some leaders may differentiate more effectively than others. Drawing from functional leadership theory, we first identify a potential approach available to leaders likely to enhance their functional effectiveness—strategically investing in and developing stronger social exchange relationships with subordinates who can best help them fulfill the task functions (via task performance-based differentiation) and group maintenance functions (via contextual performance-based differentiation) specified within functional leadership theory. Embedding this potential approach within the ability–motivation–opportunity framework, we then develop a theory for which leaders are best positioned to recognize and pursue strategic relationship development this way. Specifically, we posit that leaders with stronger cognitive abilities (g) are more likely to recognize the value of such an approach, and those high in core self-evaluation are more likely to believe in their capabilities to successfully process, execute on, and persist with the approach. The results from two studies—a multisource study of leaders and team members in newly formed teams as well as a preregistered online vignette study using a sample of current and former supervisors—largely supported our predictions.

These are key limitations because the workplace and society at large are getting increasingly diverse and because selection system designers often have interest in multiple criteria. Therefore, the article extends existing methods for designing PO selection systems to situations involving multiple criteria and multiple minority groups (i.e., multiobjective PO selection systems). We first present a hybrid multiobjective PO approach for computing selection systems that are PO with respect to (a) a set of quality objectives (i.e., criteria) and (b) a set of diversity objectives where each diversity objective relates to a different minority group. Next, we propose three two-dimensional subspace procedures that aid selection designers in choosing between the PO systems in case of a high number of quality and diversity objectives. We illustrate our novel multiobjective PO approaches via several example applications, thereby demonstrating that they are the first to reveal the complete gamut of eligible PO selection designs and to faithfully capture the Pareto trade-off front in case of more than two objectives. In addition, a small-scale cross-validation study confirms that the resulting PO selection designs retain an advantage over alternative designs when applied in new validation samples. Finally, the article provides a link to an executable code to perform the new multiobjective PO approaches.

These skills are then typically assessed via one-shot, retrospective assessor ratings. Unfortunately, the assessment of interpersonal skills at such a trait-like level fails to capture the richness of how the interaction unfolds at the behavioral exchange level within a role-play assessment. This study uses the lens of interpersonal complementarity theory to advance our understanding of interpersonal dynamics in role-play assessment and their effects on assessor ratings. Ninety-six MBA students participated in four different flash role-plays as part of diagnosing their strengths and weaknesses. Apart from gathering assessor ratings and criterion measures, coders also conducted a fine-grained examination of how the behavior of the two interaction partners (i.e., MBA students and role-players) unfolded at the moment-to-moment level via the Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics (CAID) measurement tool. In all role-plays, candidates consistently showed mutual adaptations in line with complementarity principles: Affiliative behavior led to affiliative behavior, whereas dominant behavior resulted in docile, following behavior and vice versa. For affiliation, mutual influence also occurred in that both interaction partners’ temporal trends in affiliation were entrained over time. Complementarity patterns were significantly related to ratings of in situ (role-playing) assessors but not to ratings of ex situ (remote) assessors.

Based on the literature on employees’ needs for autonomy and mastery, combined with the empowering nature of autonomy-helping, we reasoned that autonomy- (vs. dependency-) helping typically signals greater benevolence toward recipients, enhancing their support for their helpers’ leadership. Our findings were generalized across various samples (of U.S. and Israeli employees), manipulations, and research settings: simulations (Studies 1 and 2b), workplace role-play scenario (Study 2a), and recollections of helping events in the workplace (Study 3). We found that autonomy- (vs. dependency-) helping increased recipients’ support for their helpers’ leadership by heightening perceptions of helpers’ benevolence-based (rather than ability-based) trustworthiness (Studies 1 and 3). We also showed time pressure to be a boundary condition under which the advantage of autonomy-helping disappeared (Studies 2a and 2b)—with dependency-helping then inducing comparable levels of perceived benevolence and thus similar support for the helper’s potential leadership. Overall, we shed light on the development of informal leadership by uncovering how recipients interpret and respond to the two help types. Practically, this analysis opens the door to new ways for aspiring managers to enhance support for their leadership from potential followers, available even to those unlikely to be appointed to formal leadership positions.

However, this is not always the case. To address this oversight, we introduce and examine the phenomenon of alternate choices: Employees who are selected for a role but perceive or discover that they were not the first choice. Drawing on social identity theory, we contend that alternate choices seek less feedback directly from others due to experiencing less social integration and examine whether leader inclusion offsets these effects. Our studies cycling between experimental and field survey designs support the proposed theory. Taken together, we illuminate how selection processes and decisions made before role entry can impact employees’ subsequent work experiences and behavior after they enter the role, providing insights for theory and research on socialization, feedback seeking, and inclusion at work.

However, many organizations comply by advertising very broad salary ranges. Here, we examine how the width of a pay range influences prospective applicants’ perceptions. Although in other contexts people often exhibit a preference for vaguely specified gains, we draw from decision and signaling theories to hypothesize negative reactions to highly ambiguous pay ranges and test them in three preregistered experiments. In Study 1, business students evaluate a job posting with the width of the salary range manipulated between subjects. Study 2 tests for moderating effects of ambiguity explanations using a within-subjects manipulation of pay range width counterbalanced across two job postings and a sample of college graduates with relevant work experience. In Study 3, a diverse sample of recent job seekers predict a salary offer for a hiring vignette in which both the extent of ambiguity in the advertised pay range and the chosen candidate’s qualifications are manipulated; their qualitative impressions of the organization are also analyzed. Results provide converging evidence for modal aversion to high ambiguity resulting from negative effects on perceived organizational trustworthiness and skewed predictions of salary offers. Practical implications of this aspect of pay transparency are discussed, as well as broader theoretical implications for understanding outcome ambiguity effects in domains where decision makers vary in their beliefs about underlying reasons for vagueness in communicated information.

Racial differences in the effects of workplace mistreatment on depression","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001170","","Previous studies have found that workplace mistreatment positively relates to depression, a critical mental health disorder. However, it is unknown whether mistreatment affects all individuals’ depressive symptoms equally. Drawing from the hopelessness theory of depression and the stigma literature, we suggest that Blacks suffer from greater depression than Whites when they experience similar levels of workplace mistreatment because Blacks, as members of a racial minority group, are more likely to attribute workplace mistreatment to their race. This, in turn, causes them to make a pessimistic attribution (i.e., attributions that are internal, stable, and global) about themselves that, ultimately, leads to depression. We tested these predictions across two studies. In Study 1, we used a multiyear time-lagged design and multiple indicators of depression (i.e., self-reported clinical depression scale, device-traced sleep quantity, and self-reported sleep quality) and found that the positive relationship between workplace mistreatment and depression was stronger for Blacks than Whites, and that these patterns were consistent across the various indicators (although only results with the clinical depression scale and sleep quantity were statistically significant). In Study 2, we found that the influence of workplace mistreatment on depression is partly due to racial differences in how workplace mistreatment is attributed. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and directions for future research.

The role of prospective leaders’ social category membership in the differential effects of authentic and ethical leadership on stereotype threat","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001156","","Increasing racial diversity in organizations remains a challenge, as stereotype threat undermines the performance and career aspirations of minority group members during job recruitment. The present study examines how prospective leaders can leverage their influence on their followers’ identities to mitigate the stereotype threat Black individuals face in this context. We explore the effects of two moral leadership styles (ethical vs. authentic) on stereotype threat in the context of recruitment. Specifically, we investigate whether prospective leaders’ ingroup status moderates the relationship between ethical versus authentic leadership styles and candidates’ stereotype threat during the selection process and candidates’ willingness to join the organization. To this end, we conducted four experiments with Black residents of Brazilian favelas (impoverished neighborhoods), two of which included real-world job recruitment processes and physiological measures of stress (i.e., salivary cortisol and blood pressure). The results indicate that when the prospective leaders are from the outgroup, displaying ethical leadership by relying on community norms is more helpful in reducing Black candidates’ threat and, in turn, promotes willingness to apply for the job. In contrast, when the leader is from the ingroup, displaying authentic leadership by emphasizing the importance of an internal moral compass is more helpful in reducing threat, and this effect is mediated by the identity process of inclusion of the leader in the self. Overall, the present study suggests that prospective direct supervisors have the critical ability to reduce stereotype threat, which can negatively affect Black applicants and their desire to join organizations.

The present study contributes to this literature by adopting a novel bidirectional perspective, investigating how trait narcissism shapes and is shaped by our experiences at work. Specifically, this study examines how trait narcissism develops during the first 6 years after the transition from college to work, and how agentic versus communal work demands may either enhance or diminish the development of this trait. Reciprocal relationships between narcissism and subjective and objective work activities are examined in a sample of 1,513 college alumni who were assessed four times across a time period of 6 years. Both selection (i.e., narcissism shapes work activities) and socialization effects (i.e., narcissism is shaped by work activities) were examined using bivariate latent change score models. Results showed that trait narcissism prior to the college-to-work transition positively predicted the selection of agentic work activities at the beginning of the career, but not future changes in these activities. Importantly, the results regarding socialization effects indicated that engagement in communal activities, particularly those that require relating with others at work (e.g., to help them), diminished trait narcissism over time.

Research hints that one reason for this struggle may be that employees lack the empowerment to engage in such behaviors. Drawing on perspectives that conceptualize diversity advocacy as a moral and virtuous behavior, we integrate research on leadership and empowerment to suggest that supervisor integrity can empower observers to engage in diversity advocacy. In exploring boundary conditions, we draw on performance models to counterintuitively suggest that this effect is strongest when employees perceive a negative diversity climate, as employees see the greatest need for change in these contexts. We test our theory in three complementary studies: A field sample with employees, a preregistered experimental vignette study, and an additional preregistered immersive experiment with a behavioral dependent variable. Our results contribute to theory on diversity, empowerment, and organizational climate. Additionally, we make an empirical contribution by developing and validating a four-item diversity advocacy scale.

This meta-analysis examines the relationship between GCA and overall job performance using studies from the current century. Results across 153 samples and a total sample size of 40,740 show a mean observed validity of .16, with a residual SD of .09. Correcting for unreliability in the criterion and correcting predictive studies for range restriction produces a mean corrected validity of .22 and a residual SD of .11. While this is a much smaller estimate than the .51 value offered by Schmidt and Hunter (1998), that value has been critiqued by Sackett et al. (2022), who offered a mean corrected validity of .31 based on integrating findings from prior meta-analyses of 20th century data. We obtain a lower value (.22) for 21st century data.

We argue that progress in this research area has been hampered by a lack of clarity about what multiple team membership (MTM) is and how to conceptualize it. Prevailing conceptualizations of MTM have focused on the total number of teams an individual is a member of (MTM number). We identify how frequently employees shift their attention between different team contexts (MTM switching) and the extent to which they prioritize one membership over all others (MTM coreness) as alternative conceptualizations that better capture MTM’s consequences for individuals. Our analysis of 1,345 knowledge workers involved in 4,329 project teams shows that MTM number, MTM switching, and MTM coreness differ meaningfully in their antecedents and consequences. MTM switching and coreness (but not MTM number), respectively, relate positively and negatively to multiteamers’ emotional exhaustion and subsequent turnover. The positive consequences of MTM coreness only occur, however, when multiteamers have prior work experience with the members of their teams (i.e., team member familiarity). These findings help to clarify the potential benefits and detriments of MTM and advance the growing literature in this area.

In this context, we investigated how doxing (i.e., using social media to post information online with malintent) influences hiring-related decisions. Based on the integration of a political affiliation and state suspicion model, we investigated how a dox containing different types of information (affirming a political party affiliation vs. providing derogatory/negative information about an opposing party) and political party affiliation similarity influenced hiring-related perceptions of job applicants. Given doxing’s characteristics, we expanded the “decision space” to include effects about expected organizational image and expected retaliation. In Study 1, we found that the type of information and party similarity influenced suspicion of the applicant and perceived similarity with the applicant, whereas doxing only influenced suspicion. In turn, suspicion and perceived similarity predicted expected task performance and organizational image, and exploratory analyses suggested an interactive effect of these variables. Suspicion also predicted expected retaliation from individuals outside the organization. In Study 2, we confirmed that doxing was related to suspicion as well as the interactive effect of information type and party similarity. We explain that interaction using the notion of symbolic threat. In both studies, the effects of type of information and party similarity were pervasive. Our results support the similarity–attraction paradigm and a model of political affiliation. Expanding relevant theories to include suspicion helps better understand politically related judgments and the additional outcomes of expected organizational image and retaliation.

Although there is very little research on the topic in our field, evidence from a wide variety of other disciplines points to the importance of clothing in the workplace. In this article, we review this evidence and identify three universal and distinctive clothing characteristics at work: formality, provocativeness, and fashionability. We also identify two other categories: uniforms and religiosity of clothing, which are tied to particular social groups. Drawing on attribution theory and the stereotype content model, we provide a cohesive conceptual framework in which clothing characteristics influence observers’ perceptions of wearer’s warmth and competence through observers’ dispositional attribution processes. These perceptions, in turn, influence facilitation behaviors, such as providing support to wearers, and harm behaviors, such as negatively biased performance appraisal. We conclude by offering suggestions for future research and implications for employees and employers with regard to managing clothing choices and avoiding potential biases.

Most of extant research has focused on how each characteristic or them as a composite predicts outcomes. However, these variable-centered approaches fail to address how there may be subpopulations of members who differentially combine the PG fit characteristics and how such conjunctive effects differentially relate to various work outcomes. To address these issues, we adopt a profile-based approach using latent profile analysis to understand how group members are similar to and different from each other on more holistic configurations of perceived PG fit experiences. With two widely different samples of employees working in group settings, we found seven unique profiles of PG fit: perfect fits, comfortable fits, surface-level misfits, out of syncs, social misfits, lone wolves, and total misfits. We also found in Sample 2 that these profiles differentially predicted group member outcomes commonly studied in the PG fit literature, including attitudes (satisfaction and cohesion), performance behaviors (task performance and citizenship behaviors of helping and voice), and withdrawal (social loafing and turnover). Complementing research that used variable-centered approaches, our profile-based results reveal new theoretical and practical insights of perceived PG fit, suggesting that different group members have distinct configurations of PG fit, and that higher levels of PG fit are not universally positive, and neither is every type of misfit universally negative.

Because of this, political conversations have the potential to be emotionally charged and disruptive, creating tension in the workplace and negatively affecting employee productivity and well-being. In light of this possibility, the goal of the current investigation was to examine the costs of ambient political conversations in the workplace, assuming that simply overhearing such discussions—without being a participant in them—may have unintended consequences for employees. Across three studies, our findings indicated that employees experience negative affect after overhearing political conversations at work, with these effects being attenuated (amplified) in contexts where employees perceive that their coworkers are more (less) similar to them. In addition to unpacking the mechanisms through which ambient workplace political conversations might impact employee outcomes, our findings from Studies 3A–B provide evidence that under certain circumstances (i.e., when employees agree with the content of ambient workplace political conversations), employees may experience a boost in positive affect after overhearing such conversations at work. Altogether, our findings provide insight into the costs and potential benefits associated with overhearing coworkers discussing politics in the workplace, particularly for those employees who perceive themselves to be dissimilar from their coworkers.

Our research examines why leaders adopt LBLMs and the implications of this focused leadership strategy on team sales performance and pro-environmental behavior. Utilizing social information processing theory, we examine LBLM as a mediator and contend that competitive action intensity in the work environment provokes LBLM, which then signals to teams the importance of raising sales performance and reducing pro-environmental behavior. We also suggest that leader performance reward expectancy (i.e., perceptions that rewards are directly tied to high performance) serves as a first-stage moderator and team performance reward expectancy serves as a second-stage moderator, with higher (vs. lower) levels of each strengthening the indirect effects of competitive action intensity, through LBLM, onto team sales performance and pro-environmental behavior. Utilizing field data from a large pharmaceutical company (Study 1) as well as an experimental causal chain design (Studies 2a and 2b), we found support for our theoretical model.

Here, we draw on functional theories of boredom and theories of emotion regulation to develop an episodic model of how boredom shapes employee attention and productivity over time. We argue that employees often suppress boredom at work to “power through” boring tasks and objectives, resulting in residual bouts of mind-wandering—and thus productivity deficits—during future performance episodes. However, following boredom on an initial task, the commencement of a subsequent task that employees perceive to be meaningful creates an attentional pull that breaks the link between boredom and future mind-wandering, preventing the effects of boredom from spilling over to inhibit future productivity. Study 1 draws on archival experience sampling data to test our hypotheses and examine whether boredom exhibits reciprocal relationships with mind-wandering and productivity over time. Study 2 uses an experimental design to determine whether boredom and task meaningfulness interact to exert a causal effect on future mind-wandering. Study 3 uses a time-separated single-day design to replicate Studies 1 and 2 and examine our contention that employees often suppress boredom at work which, rather than preventing the effects of boredom, puts them “on hold” until a later point in time. Our findings provide insight into how to mitigate the far-reaching effects of boredom at work; they also advance episodic accounts of emotions, attention, and performance in organizations.

However, we consider whether there might be room to broaden the scope of change-oriented leadership by examining more negative-focused leadership behaviors. In this article, we explore the concept of vigilant leadership, which we suggest could be a change-oriented and negative-focused leadership style, and investigate its usefulness as a new leadership construct. In Study 1, we take preliminary steps toward developing a measure of vigilant leadership, employing content adequacy assessment and item response theory analysis. Drawing on the integrative trait-behavioral model of leadership effectiveness (DeRue et al., 2011), we further explore how vigilant leadership is associated with an array of antecedents (i.e., leader characteristics) and leadership outcomes. In Studies 2a and 2b, we present initial findings that leaders high on consideration of future consequences, prevention focus, general self-efficacy, and emotional intelligence might be more inclined to exhibit vigilant leadership. In Study 3, our results suggest that, even after controlling for the effect of visionary leadership (a type of positive-focused change-oriented leadership), vigilant leadership is positively related to follower felt responsibility for change, proactivity, specific proactive work behaviors (taking charge, voice, and problem prevention), teamwork proactivity, and teamwork proficiency. However, it does not seem to relate to follower proficiency, follower adaptivity, teamwork adaptivity, organizational citizenship behavior, positive affect toward the leader, leader–member exchange, or relational identification with the leader. With these preliminary findings, we encourage further discussion and investigation into the potential implications of this emerging construct.

However, current theoretical frameworks of conflict contagion posit a static growth trajectory in which members become engaged in conflict and stay in conflict. While this trajectory is certainly possible, the broader conflict literature outside of the organizational sciences has shown evidence for a more varied set of potential trajectories of conflict contagion. To advance theory on team conflict, we integrate conflict research from micro-level (interpersonal) to macro-level (interstate) perspectives into a formal theory of intrateam conflict contagion. Drawing from conflict stage and social contagion theory, we theorize that team members move through three stages of conflict (disengaged, at-risk, engaged) at rates determined by four process mechanisms (faultlines, forgiveness, frustration, integration) such that disengaged individuals become at-risk of engaging in conflict, engage in conflict, then disengage, only to potentially become at risk of reengaging at a later point in time. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate the generative sufficiency of our theory to account for conflict trajectories observed in the broader conflict literature. To facilitate the interpretation of such trajectories, we present a typology of contagion trajectories, discuss the dynamic properties of these trajectories (e.g., stability, bifurcations), and provide implications for future theory building and practice.

The daily effects of enacting multiple professional identities on work meaningfulness","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001176","","People increasingly support themselves through multiple jobholding—concurrently performing more than one job—and spend time enacting their professional identities each day. In accordance with self-consistency theory, scholars have emphasized that having to act out more than one professional identity promotes a fragmented sense of self for multiple jobholders, which impedes the meaningfulness of their work. However, we assert that this prevailing view about self-inconsistency is incomplete and problematic because it overlooks consideration for how enacting multiple professional identities may be a self-expanding and stimulating experience that satisfies basic needs for growth and exploration. By jointly applying self-expansion theory and self-consistency theory to the day-to-day experience of wearing multiple hats, we unpack how and why enacting multiple professional identities has countervailing implications for work meaningfulness through its effects on stimulation and self-alienation. We also consider the moderating role of identity contrast on these pathways to meaningfulness. We investigate our assertions in a series of preregistered studies—a comprehensive test of our model in a 15-day experience sampling study (Study 1) as well as constructive replications of each stage of our model (Study 2). Overall, we offer novel insights about the day-to-day tension between stimulation and self-alienation for people who act out multiple professional identities and the impact on the meaningfulness of their work.

Further, using human evaluators to rate an interview can be expensive and time consuming. Interview scoring models have been proposed as a mechanism for reliably, accurately, and efficiently scoring video-based interviews. Yet, there is a lack of clarity and consensus around their psychometric characteristics, primarily driven by a dearth of published empirical research. The goal of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of automated video interview competency assessments (AVI-CAs), which were designed to be highly generalizable (i.e., apply across job roles and organizations). The AVI-CAs developed demonstrated high levels of convergent validity (average r value of .66), moderate discriminant relationships (average r value of .58), good test–retest reliability (average r value of .72), and minimal levels of subgroup differences (Cohen’s ds ≥ −.14). Further, criterion-related validity (uncorrected sample-weighted r¯ = .24) was demonstrated by applying these AVI-CAs to five organizational samples. Strengths, weaknesses, and future directions for building interview scoring models are also discussed.

To this end, we conducted an updated meta-analysis on the interrater reliability of supervisory ratings of job performance (k = 132 independent samples) using a new meta-analytic procedure (i.e., the Morris estimator), which includes both within- and between-study variance in the calculation of study weights. An important benefit of this approach is that it prevents large-sample studies from dominating the results. In this investigation, we also examined different factors that may affect interrater reliability, including job complexity, managerial level, rating purpose, performance measure, and rater perspective. We found a higher interrater reliability estimate (r = .65) compared to previous meta-analyses on the topic, and our results converged with an important, but often neglected, finding from a previous meta-analysis by Conway and Huffcutt (1997), such that interrater reliability varies meaningfully by job type (r = .57 for managerial positions vs. r = .68 for nonmanagerial positions). Given this finding, we advise against the use of an overall grand mean of interrater reliability. Instead, we recommend using job-specific or local reliabilities for making corrections for attenuation.

Although prior research has found that the traditional leader is associated with being White, anecdotal evidence suggests DEI leader roles are predominantly held by non-White individuals. To examine this contradiction, we draw on social role and role congruity theories to conduct three preregistered experimental studies (N = 1,913) and explore whether the DEI leader role diverges from the traditional leader role such that observers expect a DEI leader to be non-White (i.e., Black, Hispanic, or Asian). Our findings indicate that DEI leaders are generally presumed to be non-White (Study 1) and that observers perceive traits associated with non-White, rather than White, groups correspond more strongly with traits required for the DEI leader role (Study 2). We also explore the effects of congruity and find non-White candidates receive stronger leader evaluations for a DEI leader role and that this relationship is mediated by nontraditional, role-specific traits (i.e., commitment to social justice and suffered discrimination; Study 3). We conclude by discussing the implications of our work for DEI and leadership research as well as for work drawing on role theories.

Instead, researchers have predominantly used composite-level approaches based on the directions of WFC (work-to-family and family-to-work conflict). However, conceptualizing and operationalizing WFC at the composite level instead of at the dimension level has not been confirmed as a well-founded strategy. The goal of the current research is to explore whether there is theoretical and empirical evidence in the WFC literature to support the importance of dimension-level theorizing and operationalization when compared to composite-level approaches. To advance theory related to the dimensions of WFC, we begin by reviewing WFC theories and then demonstrate the relevance of resource allocation theory to the time-based dimension, spillover theory to the strain-based dimension, and boundary theory to the behavior-based dimension. From this theorizing, we highlight and meta-analytically test the relative importance of specific variables from the WFC nomological network that are theoretically connected to each dimension: time and family demands for the time-based dimension, work role ambiguity for the strain-based dimension, and family-supportive supervisor behaviors and nonwork support for the behavior-based dimension. Reviewing and drawing from bandwidth-fidelity theory, we also question whether composite-based WFC approaches are more appropriate for broad constructs (i.e., job satisfaction and life satisfaction). The results of our meta-analytic relative importance analyses generally support a dimension-based approach and overall follow the pattern of results expected from our dimension-level theorizing, even when broad constructs are considered. Theoretical, future research, and practical implications are discussed.

Drawing on the framework of affective events theory and research on anger and envy, we posit that low performance incurs abuse due to supervisor anger, whereas high performance elicits abuse due to supervisor envy. More specifically, subordinate performance has a decreasing curvilinear relationship with supervisor anger (i.e., a negative effect that gradually dissipates) and an increasing curvilinear relationship with supervisor envy (i.e., a positive effect that gradually emerges). Through supervisor anger and envy, subordinate performance therefore presents different curvilinear indirect relationships with abusive supervision. The results from two vignette-based experiments and a multiwave, multisource field study support these hypotheses. We further find that supervisor comparison orientation augments the curvilinear emergence of supervisor envy and ensuing abuse in response to higher subordinate performance. However, regardless of their level of performance orientation, supervisors are prone to higher anger and subsequent abusive supervision in response to lower subordinate performance.

Furthermore, we identify moral anger as a key mechanism.

We show that a bystander’s gender and their gender similarity to the target of mistreatment can produce identity threat, which affects whether bystanders perceive the overall organization to be rife with gendered mistreatment and unfairness. Identity threat develops via two pathways—an emotion-focused reaction and a cognitive-focused processing of the event—and each pathway distally relates to different levels of bystanders’ justice perceptions. We test these notions in three complementary studies: two laboratory experiments (N = 563; N = 920) and a large field study (N = 8,196 employees in 546 work units). Results generally show that bystanders who are women or similar in gender to the target of mistreatment reported different levels of emotional and cognitive identity threat that related to psychological gender mistreatment climate and workplace injustice following the incident as compared to men and those not similar in gender to the target. Overall, by integrating and extending bystander theory and dual-process models of injustice perceptions, through this work, we provide a potentially overlooked reason why negative behaviors like incivility, ostracism, and discrimination continue to occur in organizations.

Across six studies (n = 1,853), we create and validate a psychometrically reliable scale that captures these four forms of organizational support, as well as offer a theoretical advancement to the organizational support literature. In particular, the first five studies involve content validation; assessment of factor analytic structure; tests of test–retest reliability and measurement invariance; and establishment of discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity. The final study involves deployment of the validated, 24-item scale in the field and illustrates that the four different forms of organizational support differentially predict the discrete dimensions of job burnout, the effects of which spillover and crossover into the home domain. This investigation thus offers both empirical and theoretical contributions. Empirically, we provide applied psychologists with an instrument for measuring the four forms of organizational support, enabling the emergence of new lines of research.

The present research zooms out on the macrostructure of negotiation conversations to examine how systematic differences in conversation dynamics—the structural and temporal patterns that arise from the presence or absence of speech between interlocutors—relate to objective and relational outcomes at the bargaining table. We examined 38,564 speech turns from 239 online negotiation recordings and derived, for each negotiator (N = 380), 16 measures pertaining to seven dimensions of conversation dynamics: speaking time, turn length, pauses, speech rate, interruptions, backchannels, and response time. Network analyses reveal that many of these measures are interconnected, with clusters of variables suggesting broad differences in negotiators’ propensity to “talk vs. listen” and to mimic their counterparts. Regression and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) analyses further show that several measures uniquely predict objective and relational outcomes in videoconference negotiations. At the objective level, negotiators who speak more, faster, and with fewer pauses tend to get better deals.

Drawing from the social cognitive model of career management and the boundaryless career perspective, we depart from this predominant view and examine the “double-edged sword” effects of career support mentoring on newcomer turnover. We propose that career support mentoring received by newcomers is likely to elicit both internal proactive socialization and external career self-management, which act as countervailing forces driving newcomer turnover in opposite directions (i.e., the retention pathway and the unintended detrimental pathway). We further propose that the organizational role of the mentor—supervisor versus nonsupervisor—is critical in determining which pathway prevails. We conducted two multiwave newcomer studies to test our hypotheses. In Study 1 (N = 495), we found that received career support mentoring was associated with lower newcomer turnover probability through the serial mediation of internal proactive socialization and perceived internal marketability but higher newcomer turnover probability through the serial mediation of external career self-management and perceived external marketability. In Study 2 (N = 193), we found that received career support mentoring was associated with lower newcomer turnover intention through the serial mediation of internal career advancement expectation and internal proactive socialization but higher newcomer turnover intention through the serial mediation of external career advancement expectation and external career self-management. In both studies, the unintended detrimental pathway was significant only when a newcomer’s mentor was not a supervisor.

Extant work–nonwork interventions are diverse in terms of content and effectiveness. We map these interventions onto work–nonwork theories that explain why the interventions should improve proximal work–nonwork outcomes (i.e., conflict, enrichment, balance). Our resulting integrative framework suggests that interventions can affect work–nonwork outcomes via distinct mechanisms, which can be delineated according to their (a) content valence (i.e., increasing resources/positive characteristics or decreasing demands/negative characteristics); (b) locality (i.e., personal or contextual factors); and (c) domain (i.e., work, the nonwork, or the boundary-spanning). We further provide a meta-analytic review of the efficacy of such interventions based on 6,680 participants within 26 pre–post control group design intervention studies. The meta-analytic results reveal an overall significant main effect across all identified interventions for improving proximal work–nonwork outcomes. When comparing different kinds of interventions aimed at increasing resources, we found beneficial effects for interventions targeting personal resources over contextual resources and interventions in the nonwork domain compared to interventions in the work or boundary-spanning domain. We conclude that work–nonwork interventions effectively improve the work–nonwork interface and discuss theoretical and practical implications of the more substantial effects and potential advantages of interventions aimed at enhancing personal resources in the nonwork domain. Finally, we provide concrete recommendations for future research and elaborate on the type of studies we would like to see in terms of interventions targeting the reduction of demands, for which we found only a limited number of studies.

Parker; Kapoutsis, Ilias","00_The contingent nature of the political skill-employee performance relationship","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001107","","The prevailing perspective in the organizational politics literature is that political skill facilitates heightened employee performance. Indeed, meta-analytic results have consistently found a positive relationship between political skill and both task and contextual performance. However, the literature has neglected the possibility of a contingent relationship between political skill and employee performance, despite arguments that organizations are political arenas in which employees also need political will. This is problematic because although politics are described as an ever-present facet of organizations, the extent to which work environments are politicized varies (Pfeffer, 1981), and such contexts can either constrain or enhance organizational behavior (Johns, 2006, 2018). Therefore, underpinned by the multiplicative framework of performance (i.e., P = f(M × A × C); Hirschfeld et al., 2004), we argue that the effects of political skill on employee task and contextual performance are contingent upon employee political will and the degree to which the work context is politicized. Results from a sample of working adults and their supervisors provided support for our hypothesis. Namely, political skill and political will interacted to predict heightened levels of task performance and citizenship behavior within more political contexts, but not within less political contexts. The contributions of this study to the politics literature are discussed commensurate with this study’s associated strengths and limitations.

However, past research tends to neglect the costs of reaching impasse by excluding impasses from measures of negotiation performance. Departing from this convention, we incorporate the economic costs of impasses into measures of negotiation performance to provide a more holistic examination of negotiation outcomes. In so doing, we reveal a reversal of the oft-cited male performance advantage when obtaining an impasse is especially economically costly (as is the case when negotiators have weak negotiation alternatives). Specifically, we predicted that female negotiators would make less assertive first offers than men due to their more relational orientation and that these gender differences in offer assertiveness should result in women avoiding impasse more often than men. Since avoiding impasses should improve negotiation performance when negotiators are able to obtain a deal that is more valuable than their negotiation alternative, women’s tendency to avoid impasses should improve their performance when negotiators have weak (vs. strong) alternatives. These predictions were supported in eight studies (three preregistered) across various negotiation contexts, comprising data from the television show Shark Tank (Study 1), four incentive-compatible negotiation simulations (Studies 2 and 3, Supplemental Studies), and a multistudy causal experimental chain (Supplemental Studies 4a–c).

Individuals carry with them a wide array of experiences, attitudes, and dispositions that may influence their proneness for risk-taking and incident involvement. Yet, measuring risk propensity has proven challenging due to the high levels of transparency found in the self-report measures that are presently available. We initially developed 28 conditional reasoning items to measure risk and incident propensity. With four developmental samples, we evaluated item characteristics. After applying item decision guidelines for conditional reasoning tests, we retained 14 items. Using three test samples and with the 14-item CRT-RIP, we assessed predictive and incremental validity over five-factor personality traits and an explicit, self-report measure of risk propensity. With one final sample, we provided further validation of the 14-item CRT-RIP. Findings demonstrate initial success in predicting various safety behaviors and outcomes. Ability to measure risk propensity and to predict safety behaviors is valuable because of the profound consequences that may proceed failure to enact safety behaviors including property damage, injury, illness, or even death. We discuss potential applications and suggest directions for future research.

Research examining the connection between pay and health, however, remains a relative rarity. The work that has been done is scattered across disparate disciplines and lacks a unified framework for systematically exploring the effects of pay on health. We argue that greater insecurity at work, as well as rising discontent over wages and work conditions, necessitates a richer understanding of the ways in which organizational pay affects employee psychological, physiological, and behavioral health. We first conduct a comprehensive review of existing research across a broad range of disciplines, taking note of the different ways that pay is conceptualized and the impact it has on employee health. We identify critical knowledge gaps in why and when pay is related to health, noting several disciplinary trends. Drawing on prominent theories of occupational health, we then build a theoretical framework that illustrates three mechanisms underlying the effect of pay on health. We further advance prior work by integrating allostatic load theory to explain how pay gets “under the skin” to affect health, while also identifying relevant moderators and boundary conditions. Taken together, our review integrates findings from a variety of disciplines and facilitates knowledge building across these fields to generate a more comprehensive understanding of the connection between pay and health.

To help manage this situation, leaders sometimes express laughter in the hopes that it will “lubricate” their interaction and reduce perceptions that they are aggressive or confrontational with the critical questioner. Ironically, leaders’ laughter may backfire by diminishing their apparent friendliness and approachability in the eyes of the witnessing followers. In this article, we employ an emotional aperture perspective to examine two seemingly contradictory theoretical perspectives regarding the potential impact of laughter on the witnessing followers’ perception of a leader’s warmth and effectiveness. Findings from nine studies across 2,012 adults show that leader laughter—even expressed briefly—bolsters or damages leader effectiveness depending on one important contingency: whether the leader’s laughter is shared by the questioner. Unshared laughter reduces leader effectiveness by undermining leaders’ apparent warmth, while shared laughter increases leader effectiveness by enhancing leaders’ apparent warmth. We discuss implications for the literature on emotion expression, leadership events, and leader perception and influence.

How the number of negotiation issues affects integrative bargaining","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001149","","The present research investigates how the number of issues affects the quality of outcomes in terms of joint gains and impasse rates in integrative negotiations. In the literature, two opposing positions exist reflecting a complexity dilemma regarding the number of negotiation issues: One position suggests that complex negotiations involving higher numbers of issues offer more trade-off opportunities, thereby providing negotiators with greater structural flexibility in reaching mutually beneficial agreements, which improves outcome quality. The opposite position emphasizes that the greater information load inherent in negotiating more issues impedes outcome quality. We propose a third, intermediate position: Negotiating more issues may only improve outcome quality up to a threshold, above which adding further issues results in deteriorated outcomes. We tested these propositions using a quasi-meta-analytic technique by examining the associations between the number of issues, joint gains, and impasse rates across multiple empirical studies on integrative negotiations using various negotiation tasks with different numbers of issues (N = 38,063/21,271 negotiations for joint gains/impasse rates). Moreover, we investigated whether factors related to how negotiators subjectively deal with the increased complexity associated with higher numbers of issues moderate the number-of-issues effect on joint gains. Multilevel analyses revealed no significant number-of-issues effect on joint gains up to a threshold of 3 issues but a negative effect for negotiations involving more than 3 issues. By contrast, we did not find a number-of-issues effect on impasse rates. Moreover, we did not obtain evidence for moderation effects. Findings are discussed with respect to their theoretical and practical implications.

Drawing on punctuated equilibrium models of system change and cognitive dissonance theory, we extend boundary theory through a conceptual model that explains how and when individuals may tear down and rebuild work and family role boundaries in the mind in order to maintain well-being. We argue that divergent events compel individuals to enact role boundaries inconsistent with those held internally in the mind, resulting in cognitive dissonance. We further argue that high levels of cognitive dissonance past a threshold may trigger a revolutionary change in the deep structure of one’s internally drawn role boundaries, resulting in a significant change in the extent to which work and family roles are cognitively segmented or integrated. We also argue that change events that generate lower levels of cognitive dissonance can be mitigated with boundary management tactics that create only incremental changes to work and family role boundaries. Our model advances a dynamic perspective of boundary theory that returns focus to the boundary placement process, which is often overlooked in work–family research.

Our research builds on conservation of resources theory to shift this consensus by examining the negative effects of supervisor-directed gossip on recipients. We theorize that hearing negative supervisor-directed gossip triggers both cognition- and affect-focused rumination, which consume resources, and we develop a research question around the moderating role of hearing positive supervisor-directed gossip. Furthermore, we propose that the aforementioned effects have cascading implications for recipients’ work behaviors the following day. In a 15-day experience sampling investigation of 122 workers, we found that on days when employees hear negative gossip about the supervisor, they are more likely to engage in cognition- and affect-focused rumination, and hearing positive supervisor-directed gossip strengthens these positive relationships. In addition, we found that cognition- and affect-focused rumination lead to poor sleep quality and diminished next-morning vitality, which in turn results in reduced work engagement and supervisor-directed organizational citizenship behavior.

(1996)","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001179","","Differences in employee evaluations due to gender bias may be small in any given rating cycle, but they may accumulate to produce large disparities in the number of women and men promoted to the top of an organization. A highly cited simulation by Martell et al. (1996) demonstrates this cumulative advantage process in a multilevel organization. We replicated this simulation to uncover important details about its operating assumptions, and we extended the simulation to examine a range of variables that may impact the cumulative effects of gender bias. The replication revealed that the male cumulative advantage in the Martell et al. simulation requires (a) decades of typical promotion cycles to produce, (b) constant mean differences in the performance ratings of women and men but equal within-group variances, and (c) attrition that occurs randomly at a low and constant rate. Our extended simulation demonstrates that (a) cumulative effects of gender bias are higher when the attrition rate is lower, (b) gender biases are mitigated when attrition is more strongly associated with good or poor performance, and (c) the cumulative effects of mean gender differences in performance ratings can often be smaller than the cumulative effects of variance differences between gender subgroups. Results suggest that talent development and recognition of high performers might have a greater positive impact on female representation at top levels of a firm than programs aimed at reducing bias in employee evaluations. We encourage additional simulation work that further explores the dynamics of cumulative advantage in employment settings.

Research on stereotype threat (ST) examines whether the awareness of a negative stereotype can decrease stereotyped group members’ test performance. A less commonly studied influence of stereotypes is stereotype lift (SL), defined as an increase in a group’s test performance due to not being part of a negative stereotype. For example, men might perform better on math tests if they are primed on the stereotype that men are better than women at math. Walton and Cohen (2003) previously meta-analyzed the impact of SL on cognitive tests, finding an overall d = 0.24. We report an updated meta-analysis on SL with more samples and moderator analyses.

Often, the term “toxic work climate” is used to describe patterns of aggressive behaviors that harm individuals and manifest in the broader workplace. However, despite these common references, scholars still know relatively little about what a toxic work climate actually entails, the processes by which they emerge, and their influence on organizational outcomes. The research domain is complex. Within the organizational literature alone, toxic work climates have been described as those that harbor abusive bosses, aggressive employees, and those that show signs of bullying or incivility. Our aim in this integrative conceptual review is to add precision and focus to this multidisciplinary and fragmented literature. Grounding our efforts in multilevel theories, we first introduce an overarching definition of the toxic work climate construct and review research on existing hostile climate types that can appropriately be consolidated under this new heading. We then develop a new theoretical model that outlines the dominant causes and mechanisms by which toxic work climates form, and the main pathways by which they influence employees, teams, and organizations. Finally, we provide a unified path forward for advancing theory, research, and practice, including advice on how toxic climates might be combated in years to come.

We offer insights into the psychological experience of impunity by shifting the focus to organizational settings and embedding impunity within discussions of workplace misconduct. We distinguish between (a) perceived personal impunity, which reflects employees’ belief that they will not face punishment for their own misconduct; and (b) perceived contextual impunity, which reflects employees’ belief that their organization will not punish employees for their misconduct. We develop and validate measures for each impunity perception and establish a preliminary nomological network by investigating factors that influence each perception and their relationship with workplace misconduct. Consequently, we offer nuanced insights into how distinct impunity perceptions result in workplace misconduct relative to other established predictors. Our perceived workplace impunity measures provide a valuable tool for assessing impunity perceptions and predicting instances of misconduct. In addition, they offer practical insights into impunity’s functions within organizations.

Applying regulatory focus theory, we differentiate between promotion-oriented and prevention-oriented actions to develop a within-person theory of when and why promotion-oriented and prevention-oriented actions should relate to power, and vice-versa. Across two studies, we find that when employees engaged in promotive voice behaviors, they were more likely to experience a sense of power; this effect was amplified for employees with trait promotion focus. When employees engaged in prohibitive voice behaviors, employees with trait prevention focus were less likely to experience a sense of power. The experience of power subsequently motivated employees to engage in promotive voice behaviors, but not prohibitive voice behaviors. By elucidating the differences between promotion and prevention pathways of action and power, our research challenges the notion that action and power positively reinforce each other.

Countervailing effects via feeling pride and feeling envied","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001191","","While the previous research has examined antecedents of supervisors’ voice endorsement, it has generally overlooked its effects on voicers’ affective and behavioral reactions, probably because of the underlying assumption that supervisors’ voice endorsement is inherently beneficial and likely to encourage more proactive behaviors in the future. In this research, we offer a theoretical model of the double-edged effects of supervisors’ voice endorsement on voicers’ subsequent personal initiative. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory and related research, we proposed that supervisors’ voice endorsement prompts two different cognitive appraisal processes in voicers that evoke two distinct emotional experiences—feeling pride and feeling envied—with countervailing effects on voicers’ subsequent personal initiative. Specifically, voice endorsement results in voicers not only feeling pride, which enhances their subsequent personal initiative, but also in their feeling envied, which reduces their later personal initiative. Moreover, we extend the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion from a social constructionist approach by incorporating coworker support—an important relational context—as a contingent factor shaping the effects of voice endorsement on feeling pride and feeling envied and on voicers’ subsequent personal initiative. The results from two field studies—a weekly experience sampling study with 574 observations from 119 employees and an event-based daily experience sampling study with 787 observations from 180 employees—largely support our theoretical model. This research suggests the importance of considering the perspectives of all the stakeholders in the proactivity triad (i.e., the focal employee, the supervisor, and coworkers) in order to sustain employee proactivity.

In this meta-analysis, we expand Sluss and Ashforth’s (2007) typology, going beyond the influence of the supervisor, to systematically study the antecedents and consequences of RI and its comparison with LMX. Meta-analytic results based on 157 independent samples demonstrate that positive leader behaviors that span role-based and person-based identities (e.g., transformational leadership, supervisor humility) are important antecedents of subordinate-to-supervisor RI, with effects contingent on subordinates’ national culture (i.e., collectivism and power distance). Although less hypothesized, relational and organizational contexts as well as subordinate characteristics are also important antecedents of subordinate-to-supervisor RI. The results further show that RI relates to important subordinate behaviors and attitudes. Finally, we test how RI and LMX have differing effects across these important subordinate attitudes and behaviors. We conclude with suggestions to enhance our understanding of RI.

Leaders, however, are not solely bestowers of gratitude but also recipients of it. Although leaders are often studied for their influence on others in the workplace, it is crucial to acknowledge that they are also complete individuals with personal lives outside of work that can spill over and affect their feelings and leadership behaviors at work. To advance research on leadership and gratitude, we take a whole-person view of leaders to understand the interpersonal crossover and intrapersonal spillover of gratitude. By integrating the moral affect theory of gratitude and savoring interventions research, we investigate how an intervention involving reflecting on gratitude received from family members at home motivates leaders to be more helpful and empowering toward their followers at work. We studied these ideas across three daily field experiments with 103 full-time managers from high schools, 116 leader–follower dyads from a variety of industries, and 109 leaders across various industries. Our findings demonstrate that when leaders reflected on receiving gratitude from family members at home, they felt higher prosocial impact at home, which in turn fulfilled their basic daily needs, consequently motivating them to engage in more helping and empowering behavior toward their followers at work. We also found some evidence that leaders higher in trait negative affect benefited the least from reflecting on receiving gratitude at home. We discuss how our findings provide extensions to literatures on gratitude, leadership, and work–family issues.

Our review identifies similarities and differences in these frameworks and suggests that they collectively represent an invaluable resource for personality researchers and the broader field of organizational psychology. Through our review, we distinguish multiperspective frameworks from similar approaches (e.g., multirater designs), track the evolution of these frameworks, and leverage current applications of these frameworks to craft a future research agenda.

Yet how employees process information about simultaneous comparisons, particularly when internal and external comparison information is incongruent, remains controversial. In this article, we draw from the model of dispositional attribution and equity theory to predict how the incongruence of internal and external salary comparisons affects perceptions of distributive justice and subsequent employee withdrawal behavior. We hypothesized that the effect of salary comparisons on perceived distributive justice follows a hierarchically restrictive schema in which a lower salary in comparison to a referent has a greater effect than a higher salary. This further affects employee withdrawal (neglect, turnover intention, and voluntary turnover). We also propose that the effects of salary comparisons are bounded by employees’ zero-sum construal of success. Three studies were conducted to test our hypotheses: a quasi-experimental study and two time-lagged field studies. Consistent with our hypotheses, we observed that, when comparison information was incongruent, underpayment compared with others more strongly affected perceived distributive justice than overpayment did. The subsequent impact on perceived distributive justice was negatively related to employee withdrawal. As expected, the effect of incongruent salary comparison information was stronger for employees with lower zero-sum construal of success. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

However, knowledge about how newcomers build their social networks from the ground up is limited. Extending the socialization literature, we propose a model delineating newcomer proactive networking as the driver of advice ties with peer newcomers, which in turn influence newcomer reputation among higher status organizational insiders. Drawing on signaling theory, we propose that future-oriented newcomers are more likely to engage in proactive networking behaviors, a form of signaling that could help those newcomers build a larger number of peer advice ties. Such initial success may then transmit newcomers’ signals to the managerial ranks, affording them a better reputation among managers. In addition, signaling theory suggests that the centrality of a newcomer’s immediate supervisor in the managerial advice network can amplify the effect of the newcomer’s own signaling actions (i.e., proactive networking behaviors) on their relationships with peers. We tested our hypotheses in two field survey studies. Study 1 found that newcomers higher in future orientation engaged in more proactive networking. Proactive networking helped newcomers form more peer advice ties, which were, in turn, positively related to their reputation among managers. Study 2 found that the supervisor’s centrality in the managerial advice network moderated the relationship between newcomer proactive networking and peer advice ties. We discuss the implications of our findings for the newcomer adjustment and signaling theory literatures as well as for socialization practices.

Drawing on the attention-based view of work behavior, we propose that employees do not always remain vigilant to such threats. Consequently, we argue that, in the face of those threats, employees can fail to notice or recognize problems or vulnerabilities in their organizations’ work processes or products that can hinder coping. We posit that this effect is, paradoxically, more pronounced when employees are working with trustworthy managers who are perceived as capable and focused enough on the well-being of their units to adequately deal with work challenges. Thereby, we highlight that employees may overlook problems and thus not speak up, precisely when their input is highly desired to address ambiguous threats and can be effectively used by competent and caring managers. Using a combination of field surveys and preregistered experiments, we demonstrate support for our arguments. In the process, we present an alternative attention-based perspective to the voice literature that has so far predominantly focused on cost–benefit-based explanations (i.e., how employees evaluate the perceived costs of speaking up vs. presumed benefits) when describing hurdles to employee voice.

While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of task proactivity, little is known about its cognitive costs. To investigate this issue, we build theory on how task proactivity affects end-of-day cognitive performance. We propose that task proactivity involves deviating from established ways of working and engaging in cognitively demanding activities requiring high levels of mental effort, which manifest as an erosion of end-of-day cognitive performance. In two daily diary studies, we found that individuals engaging in task proactivity experience lower end-of-day cognitive performance (Study 1 over five consecutive workdays: n = 163, k = 701; Study 2 with multiple daily assessments over seven consecutive workdays: n = 93, k = 471), even when controlling for task performance (Study 1) and beginning-of-day cognitive performance (Study 2). In two experiments, we then show that simulating task proactivity results in greater mental effort and lower routineness but not in greater ego depletion (Study 3: N = 318 and Study 4: N = 319) or increased self-control demands, -effort, or -motivation (Study 4). This provides support for our proposed cognitive pathway. Our findings enhance our understanding of the cognitively demanding nature of task proactivity and provide empirical support for its cognitive costs using a mental fatigue lens. They also suggest that the impact of a cognitively demanding activity like task proactivity may persist throughout the day and carry over to other tasks involving cognitive performance.

In the original article, the adverse impact ratios for the dotted lines in Figure 1 are incorrect. The error does not impact the conclusions of this research, and the corrected figure is shown in the erratum.] General mental ability (GMA) tests have long been at the heart of the validity–diversity trade-off, with conventional wisdom being that reducing their weight in personnel selection can improve adverse impact, but that this results in steep costs to criterion-related validity. However, Sackett et al. (2022) revealed that the criterion-related validity of GMA tests has been considerably overestimated due to inappropriate range restriction corrections. Thus, we revisit the role of GMA tests in the validity–diversity trade-off using an updated meta-analytic correlation matrix of the relationships six selection methods (biodata, GMA tests, conscientiousness tests, structured interviews, integrity tests, and situational judgment tests) have with job performance, along with their Black–White mean differences. Our results lead to the conclusion that excluding GMA tests generally has little to no effect on validity, but substantially decreases adverse impact. Contrary to popular belief, GMA tests are not a driving factor in the validity–diversity trade-off. This does not fully resolve the validity–diversity trade-off, though: Our results show there is still some validity reduction required to get to an adverse impact ratio of .80, although the validity reduction is less than previously thought. Instead, it shows that the validity–diversity trade-off conversation should shift from the role of GMA tests to that of other selection methods. The present study also addresses which selection methods now emerge as most valid and whether composites of selection methods can result in validities similar to those expected prior to Sackett et al. (2022).

A person-centric view on employee responses to diversity initiatives","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001190","","Employees’ responses to diversity initiatives are critical to understand the effectiveness of such initiatives. However, prior research has largely considered the isolated effects of specific favorable or unfavorable employee responses (e.g., support or resistance) from a variable-centered perspective. This prior focus overlooks the potential (a) coexistence of more complex configurations of cognitive, affective, and behavioral response types within individuals and (b) the existence of subpopulations of employees who may respond both favorably and unfavorably, thus displaying ambivalence. To address these shortcomings, we build on the tripartite response model and adopt a person-centered approach to shed light on a more comprehensive spectrum of employees’ responses to diversity initiatives. Using latent profile analysis, our results across three studies reveal (Study 1, n = 605) and replicate (Study 2, n = 503 and Study 3, n = 514) four distinct response types: excited supporters, calm compliers, torn shapers, and discontent opponents. Furthermore, using time-lagged data from Study 3, we provide initial insights into relevant person and situation predictors of profile membership and show how employees across profiles differ on work-related outcomes that can be functional or dysfunctional for their organization.

However, disparate findings and a scarcity of studies examining work-related behavioral measures make it challenging to determine which interventions are better suited to reduce workplace discrimination. Derived from the tripartite theory of attitudes and the principle of compatibility, I develop a conceptual model mapping the attitude focus of interventions and code studies in this literature from the past two decades for these common properties. Based on a meta-analysis of 70 articles totaling 208 effect sizes, I test this conceptual model, finding that it helps explain why some interventions to reduce discrimination yield superior outcomes relative to others. In particular, results indicate that passive interventions, such as short-term education or reminders of bias processes, are largely ineffective in shifting behavior. Conversely, the class of interventions that targets behavior directly by attempting to inhibit the manifestation of bias (e.g., making individuals accountable for their decisions or changing social norms) emerged as the most helpful category of interventions in this area. Overall, results support a key prediction of the attitude dimension consistency perspective, demonstrating that aligning the attitude dimension primarily targeted by an intervention and the outcome measured could lead to improved results in this area.

Across five preregistered experiments, we find that people judge ideological opponents as more trustworthy when opposing opinions are expressed through a self-revealing personal narrative than through either data or stories about third parties—even when the content of the messages is carefully controlled to be consistent. Trust does not suffer when explanations grounded in self-revealing personal narratives are augmented with data, suggesting that our results are not driven by quantitative aversion. Perceptions of trustworthiness are mediated by the speaker’s apparent vulnerability and are greater when the self-revelation is of a more sensitive nature. Consequently, people are more willing to collaborate with ideological opponents who support their views by embedding data in a self-revealing personal narrative, rather than relying on data-only explanations. We discuss the implications of these results for future research on trust as well as for organizational practice.

Despite their distinct theoretical roots, less is known about whether and how these two proximal mechanisms complement one another in accounting for justice effects on key outcomes. Tracing back to their disparate fundamental premises—“reciprocity” underpinning social exchanges and “oneness” underpinning identity construction—we attempt to disentangle the relative mediating effects of these two mechanisms. Our empirical testing hinges on one meta-analytic study with 105 independent samples (N = 29,868), coupled with one preregistered experience-sampling study with 1,941 cross-day observations over 3 weeks from 147 subordinate–supervisor pairs. Overall, we find that exchange-based mechanisms account for more of the indirect effect of justice on task performance, whereas identity-based mechanisms (particularly interdependent identity) account for more of the indirect effect of justice on counterproductive work behavior. Regarding the indirect effect on organizational citizenship behavior, identity-based mechanisms (particularly positive self-evaluations) and exchange-based mechanisms respectively present great utility between the two studies. By providing nuanced insight into the complementary yet distinct nature of these two prominent mechanisms, our research encourages a more granular theoretical approach for studying organizational justice effects.

These approaches, however, ignore that individuals might employ more complex combinations of deviance behaviors that do not fit neatly within the existing variable frameworks. The present study explores whether person-centered deviance classes emerge in a comprehensive database of the prior studies. We then investigated whether these classes showed differences in antecedents and correlates in an independent sample of working adults from multiple industries. In Study 1, a multilevel latent class analysis of 20 independent samples and 6,218 individuals revealed five classes of workplace deviance, thus providing preliminary support for a person-centered approach. In Study 2, a time-lagged sample of 553 individuals showed the emergence of five classes that largely reflected the patterns found in Study 1. Study 2 points to meaningful differences between classes of deviance behaviors and antecedents, including abusive supervision, Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability, and psychological entitlement; classes are also uniquely associated with correlates such as organizational citizenship behaviors, turnover intentions, job performance, and job satisfaction. Altogether, this work is an important first step toward understanding workplace deviance with a person-centered lens.

Scholars have argued that it is not just whether employees cope with work–nonwork stressors—but how they cope—that matters. Indeed, prior research assumes that adaptive coping strategies—planning, prioritizing, positive reframing, seeking emotional and instrumental support—are universally beneficial, suggesting that sustaining high levels of these strategies is ideal. By returning to the roots of coping theory, we adopt a person-centered, dynamic approach using latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis across three multiwave studies (N = 1,370) to consider whether employees combine coping strategies and how remaining in or shifting between such combinations also matters. In a pilot study (N = 361), we explored profiles and their transitions during a time frame punctuated with macrolevel transitions that amplified employees’ work–nonwork stressors (i.e., COVID-19), which revealed three profiles at Time 1 (comprehensive copers, emotion-focused copers, and individualistic copers) and a fourth profile at Time 2 (surviving copers). In Study 1 (N = 648), across all three time points, we replicated three profiles and found evidence for constrained copers instead of emotion-focused copers. In Study 2 (N = 361), across both time points, we replicated all four profiles from Study 1 and tested hypotheses regarding the profiles, their transition patterns, and implications of such patterns for work, well-being, and social functioning outcomes. Altogether, our work suggests that maintaining high-coping depth or increasing depth is generally beneficial, whereas maintaining or increasing coping breadth is generally harmful.

Across one preregistered field study, where we survey 400 delivery riders in Mainland China, and three preregistered experiments (total N = 2,350), we find that AI management is perceived as less benevolent than human management. Given that benevolence is an important antecedent of trust in leaders, this perception has a negative effect on trust in AI management, even when controlling for perceived ability and integrity. Employees prefer human management to AI management in high empathy demand contexts, where individuals seek management that can empathize and experience the emotions that they are feeling, as opposed to low empathy demand contexts. These findings deepen our understanding of trust and provide important theoretical and practical insights on the implementation and adoption of AI management.

As a result, addressing false or misleading allegations has emerged as an important priority among corporate executives. In this research, we examine how CEO gender influences the effectiveness of different types of denial responses in the wake of rumor crises. We find that, after reading damaging allegations about an organization, consumers react more favorably to denials issued by male versus female CEOs. We argue that this is attributable to the dominance that characterizes denial responses, which results in a greater (negative) expectancy violation for female (vs. male) CEOs issuing such statements. Such violations result in lower trust in, and less willingness to do business with, organizations led by women (vs. men) who issue a denial response. We show that these relationships are moderated by increased prescriptive agency (i.e., clarified denials) and the attribution of the response (i.e., to the CEO vs. organization). Taken together, our findings have implications for theory on agentic characteristics, crisis communication, and female leadership, as well as practical implications for how all organizations can adopt more effective crisis responses.

How long do these effects take to unfold? What is the role of persistent WFC (or strain) levels in these processes? Prior research has left some of these questions open: Our systematic review reveals that WFC–strain studies have primarily used short (e.g., hours) or long (e.g., years) measurement lags, leaving mid-long lags underexplored. Moreover, while many work–family theories imply long-term effects, prior longitudinal research has often relied on cross-lagged panel models that assume effects to be solely within-person, not considering persistent between-person differences. We tested this assumption in five three-wave survey studies (N = 26,133) with varying lags (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year) and found it to fail in all cases. Employing the random-intercept crossed-lagged panel, a new approach in WFC research, our results indicate that the effects between WFC and strain (exhaustion, perceived stress, and affective rumination) depend primarily on longer term WFC (or strain) levels. In contrast, short-term deviations from these levels (within-person effects) play a minor role. These findings suggest that the effects between WFC and strain may be more persistent than previously assumed, opening avenues for further theoretical and empirical development.

We draw from social role theory to predict that risk-taking and empathic tendencies—as agentic and communal mechanisms, respectively—help explain how gender influences creativity. We also identify contextual moderators that can strengthen the communal pathway—predicting a more positive relationship between empathic tendency and creativity as well as a stronger indirect effect via empathic tendency when the tasks demand perspective-taking and when usefulness is explicitly incorporated in creativity assessment. With a meta-analysis of 753 independent samples (265,762 individuals), we find support for a communal pathway (i.e., women are creative via empathic tendency) and for an agentic pathway (i.e., men are creative via risk-taking tendency). We also find that the communal pathway is stronger when usefulness is explicitly incorporated in creativity assessment. Task demands for perspective-taking did not show a moderating effect. Taken together, our findings provide a more balanced account of the gender–creativity relationship, demonstrate why men and women differ in creativity and when women can leverage the communal mechanism to enhance creativity, and inform theory and practice towards a more gender-equitable workplace.

Our two-part study identifies a source of overprediction: using national norms rather than recent local applicant pool variance for range restriction corrections. Study 1 demonstrates increasing homogeneity in Wonderlic occupational applicant pool variance across four data time waves, suggesting they are no longer interchangeable with the general working population, a divergence attributable to a rise in education. Study 2 employs the Morris meta-analytic approach to gauge the impact of using national norms over occupational ones in range restriction. An analysis of 649 GMA validity coefficients from four time waves of General Aptitude Test Battery and Wonderlic data shows a radical drop in corrected and uncorrected correlations, indicating that historical corrected GMA validity coefficients differ from contemporary ones by up to 16-fold (i.e., an R² of 42.3% vs. 2.6%), and range restriction corrections are now minimal in about 75% of cases. This drop in correlations appears due to the filtering effects of increased education, both due to the demands of the knowledge economy and credentialism, where organizations are using college or university degrees as a proxy for GMA. Credentialism is an incredibly inefficient form of GMA assessment, suggesting an urgent societal need to incorporate selection fundamentals more broadly. Altogether, these results indicate that labor market dynamics have a deeper impact on personnel selection than typically appreciated, meaning that many of our estimates have and will eventually age out.

Unlike other forms of support that depend on the actions of individuals throughout the organization, benefits can be changed through decisions at the highest level and influence employees throughout the company. Yet, the literature on benefits has been largely disjointed, resulting in theoretical ambiguity and practical questions about the role of employee benefit experiences in individual employee outcomes. To inform theory and practice, we organized the benefits literature using social exchange theory as a framework and conducted a meta-analysis on the relationships of employee benefit availability, use, and subjective evaluation with perceived organizational support, employee attitudes, and well-being. Our review (k = 134, N = 260,604) found unique relationships between the availability and subjective evaluation of employee benefits and affective organizational commitment, withdrawal intentions, job satisfaction, and well-being, with these relationships partially mediated by perceived organizational support. Benefit use contributed little to these outcomes beyond benefit availability and subjective evaluation. Benefit subjective evaluation was also more strongly related to most outcomes than were benefits availability and use. These relationships varied across types of benefits, with training benefits more strongly related to job satisfaction and health care and retirement benefits more strongly related to turnover intentions.

Considerably less is known about how rudeness affects team processes and outcomes. In a series of five studies aimed at extending theories of the social–cognitive implications of rudeness to the team level, we show that rudeness is detrimental to team functioning. Using an experimental design, Study 1 shows that teams encountering rudeness perform worse than other teams. Study 2, a medical simulation study, explains this effect by showing that medical teams exposed to rudeness are less likely than other teams to share information and workload and, in turn, execute a variety of medical procedures less well. Studies 3a and 3b highlight the mediating role played by social value orientation (SVO), demonstrating that rudeness elicits these effects by diminishing members’ SVO (i.e., making team members less prosocial and more pro-self). In turn, Study 4 shows that rudeness-diminished SVO explains reduced information sharing in teams. Finally, Study 5, a laboratory study, tests a full serial mediation model, demonstrating that rudeness decreases team members’ SVO, which in turn reduces team information sharing and, as a result, encumbers team performance.

A meta-analysis of academic performance as a predictor of work performance and turnover","Journal of Applied Psychology","","1939-1854","10.1037/apl0001212","","Many organizations assess job applicants’ academic performance (AP) when making selection decisions. However, researchers and practitioners recently have suggested that AP is not as relevant to work behavior as it used to be due to factors such as grade inflation and increased differences between academic and work contexts. The present meta-analysis examines whether, and under what conditions, AP is a useful predictor of work behavior. Mean correlations (corrected for error in the criterion) between AP and outcomes were .21 for job performance (k = 114), .34 for training performance (k = 8), and −.02 for turnover (k = 20). There was considerable heterogeneity in validity estimates for job performance (80% credibility interval [.04, .37]). Moderator analyses revealed that AP is a better predictor of performance (a) for AP measures that are more relevant to students’ future jobs, (b) for professor ratings of AP than for grades and class rank, (c) for samples that include applicants from the same university or from the same major, and (d) for official records of AP than for applicant self-reports. Job relevance was the strongest and most consistent moderator with operational validities in the .30s and .40s for measures that assessed AP in major-specific courses or courses in which students are evaluated on behaviors relevant to their future jobs (e.g., practicum classes). Overall, researchers and organizations should carefully consider whether and how AP is relevant to particular jobs and outcomes, as well as use designs and measures that optimize the predictive value of AP.

There is scant knowledge about how a human resource management (HRM) system can foster organizational resilience. This study examines the role of a high-performance work system in the organizational resilience process during the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on two properties of the resilience process: stability during the jolt phase and flexibility during the turnaround phase. We test our hypotheses using quarterly sales data from 268 Korean firms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings show that an high-performance work system reduces the severity of loss during the jolt phase (i.e., it maintains stability) through an increased climate of trust and enhances the scale of recovery during the turnaround phase (i.e., it improves flexibility) through an increased climate of innovation. We advance research on HRM, organizational resilience, and crisis management, showing how an HRM system can foster two essential properties for the resilience process to unfold effectively over time after the onset of a crisis.
